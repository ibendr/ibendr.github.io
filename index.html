<h3 class="title">Ben's Games and Puzzles</h3>
<p>
This is a page I set up so that I could publish games and puzzles, and help others do the same.

<ul>
<li><a href = "96.html">
    "96" - an excellent variation of "2048", if I do say so myself. 
    </a><br>
     My best score is 41740, which I will assume is a world record until I hear otherwise!
 </li>
<li><a href = "xwd/index.html">
    Cryptic Crosswords by Ben and others (coming soon!)...
 </a><ul>
<li><a href = "xwd/bendr/index.html">
    Ben's Cryptic Crosswords - a new puzzle published each Wednesday.
