<h4>	Help...
</h4>
In any subject, but especially in Mathematics, failing to grasp one topic can lead to a lot of what follows not making sense. 
This in turn leads to frustration and disengagement.
And genuine interactive help requires some expertise.
It's not enough simply that your tutor knows the "correct" way to do each question and can show you.
As a maths enthusiast who knows many different ways to solve any given problem, and as an experienced teacher and tutor,
I can build on whatever fragments of insight a student may have to find an approach that actually makes sense to them.
<h4> (...that you need)
</h4>
Sometimes a small amount of timely intervention can help avoid years of difficulties.
I have had many clients who needed only a few sessions, or even just one session, to get over some key obstacles and get back on track.
I am always happy to take that as a "win", and will never hound you to commit to ongoing tutoring that isn't needed.
