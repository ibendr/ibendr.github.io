<h3>	Help...
</h3>
<p>
I can provide ongoing support in a subject, or just occasional help as required.
Sometimes a little bit of timely help when stuck on a particular topic can avoid a vicious cycle of dropping further behind and eventually becoming disengaged.

<h3>	... and Inspiration

<p>
Of course, sometimes students are disengaged for the opposite reason... that they are not being extended or stimulated by what they are learning.
I can provide enrichment and extension to help students rediscover the wonder of learning, especially in my favourite topic of mathematics!
Lets help kids realise their potential!

In any subject, but especially in Mathematics, failing to grasp one topic can lead to a lot of what follows not making sense. 
This in turn leads to frustration and disengagement.
And genuine interactive help requires some expertise.
It's not enough simply that your tutor knows the "correct" way to do each question and can show you.
As a maths enthusiast who knows many different ways to solve any given problem, and as an experienced teacher and tutor,
I can build on whatever fragments of insight a student may have to find an approach that actually makes sense to them.
<h4> (...that you need)
</h4>
Sometimes a small amount of timely intervention can help avoid years of difficulties.
I have had many clients who needed only a few sessions, or even just one session, to get over some key obstacles and get back on track.
I am always happy to take that as a "win", and will never hound you to commit to ongoing tutoring that isn't needed.
