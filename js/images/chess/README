You'll have worked out that pieces are represented as

Qw.gif

etc. with first (capital) letter being piece type and 
second (lower case) letter colour. Unlike some programs,
we don't have separate images for the pieces on different
coloured squares - relying on judicious choice of board
design instead.

The tiles for the boards' squares themselves are in

Ob.gif, Ow.gif

(That's the letter O not digit 0).  So what about these -

Cb.gif, Cw.gif   ?

These are part of a new idea for a way to signal castling
rights as part of the board apparatus.  The idea is that
a C (for "Castle") is a rook whose castling right has not
yet been forfeited. i.e. one who has not moved and whose
King has not yet moved either.  (This does not mean castling
is currently legal, it's just recording the relevant fact
about the game history).

So rather than have flags extraneous to the board position,
we have the extra piece C, which moves just like a rook except
that when it does it simultaneously turns into a rook.
(So it only ever moves at most once as a C). It also gets turned
into a rook when it's king moves.  Then the castling rule,
rather than consult game history, merely specifies that
the king can only castle with a Castle, not with a Rook.

We could similarly avoid needing an en-passant flag by
inventing another piece for a pawn-that-has-just-double-moved.
Call it E for EnPassant. So we modify a pawn to say that
double-moving transforms it into a EnPassant, but also
that any move turns any existing EnPassant back into a Pawn.
(Ideally the other person's move does this.)

A final touch would be to remove the need to separately
record whose turn it is to play.  We could add an
alternative piece for the king of the player whose
turn it is - e.g. "M" for Mover's king.
