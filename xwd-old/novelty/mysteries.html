		<h1>Crossword Archives : Novelty : Mystery Puzzles</h1>

	<p>Each of these puzzles is lacking clues for one or several of it's answers.  In some cases,  in particular the "Unlucky ..." puzzles there is one unclued entry,  but lots of cross-references to and/or lots of cross-checking of that word.  In the other cases,  the unclued words form part of a natural set,  such as the names of the months of the year.  They may also be a selection from a larger set,  such as names of countries.
