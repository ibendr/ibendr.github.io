		<h1>Crossword Archives : Novelty : Themed Grids </h1>

		<p> In these puzzles,  there are clues to the theme or to some of the answers placed in the grid itself.  This may be in the arrangement of the live and blocked cells,  the shape of the grid,  or in its colouring or other decoration.  Look out for clues that mention colours in the grid,  or "grid art" etc.
		<p> There is some overlap between this list and the "Novelty Shapes" list.
