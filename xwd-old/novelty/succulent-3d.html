	<h3>This is a 3 dimensional crossword.</h3>

<P>Each small square grid is one layer of a 4x4x4 cubic grid.  The directions Across and Down are within each layer,  while the 'Through' direction goes from a cell in one layer to the corresponding cell in the next layer.  To illustrate,  the spot for 6-Through has been highlighted.

<P>This particular grid has all 4-letter spots,  and each live cell is in exactly 2 spots.  So within each layer,  those eight letters that are not intersections of Across and Down spots are cross-checked by Through spots.

<P>This is quite a small puzzle,  by way of an introduction to 3D grids.  To set a 3D puzzle with about the same number of cells as a regular 15x15 grid (225 cells),  I would use a 6x6x6 grid (216 cells).

<P>
