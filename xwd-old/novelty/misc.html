		<h1>Crossword Archives : Miscellaneous Novelty Crosswords</h1>
<P> These are puzzles that don't quite fit into any of my other "novelty" categories.  This can mean either of two things - either they really are genuine original one-off novelties worthy of the label,  or they're just crosswords that didn't quite work well enough to pass off as proper cryptic crosswords,  having quirks (or faults) that might cause complaint if they were listed among the "regular"s.  Inbetween these extremes there's some mini-categories not big enough to warrant their own archive page here,  such as puzzles with versed clues (do I hear groaning?).
