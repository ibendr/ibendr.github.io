<h3>The Clue</h3>

<p>1 Across (4,6,5) :  What happened in the 6-Down (9) 9-Across (6) of 1975,  when the Australian 5-Down (10) was 28-Across (9,6) in great 7-Down (5),  10-Down (2,1,9) concocted plot (which now 2-Down (5) of involvement by another country ... not one in nearby 23-Across (4) but an American country (not an 22-Across (6) one like 25-Down (4),  but that Union of States including (eg) 17-Across (5) )),  with 20-Across (3,6) who did the deed citing the 4-Down (12),  but willing to 24-Down (5) in acting without the 1-Down (9) of she to whom he was supposedly 8-Across (8),  thereby 14-Down (10) much of the 26-Across (6) and many of their 15-Across (9),  who,  once 18-Down (9) from power,  would eventually have to "let 27-Across (8) dogs lie" (as the 16-Down (4,5) Che Guevara might've 3-Down (4) - but probably not) even though they would ever 13-Across (3) the sneakiness of the GG (not a horse,  although he once famously 11-Across (4) face at a major 12-Across (6)'s race) in having Mal's 21-Across (3) (which wasn't a Ford 21-Down (5) by the way) hidden from view when expecting the PM to 19-Across (5) 5-Down (10) House that day.
