		<h1>Crossword Archives : Novelty : Long Entry Puzzles</h1>

<p> These are puzzles where either a long phrase (or phrases) or extremely pervasive theme dominates the puzzle.  This can be unsatisfying if you don't crack the phrase etc.,  as you tend to be then left with disjointed fragments of solvable puzzle.  In some cases a long phrase is almost unclued,  and a couple of these puzzles can also be found in the "Mystery" listing.
