		<h2>Information</h2>


<h3>The Author</h3>

<p>My name is Ben Robinson,  and I have many interests including games and puzzles of all sorts.  I have been composing cryptics since about 2001.  I'm a single parent on the lookout for a (semi-)regular income,  so if you're a newspaper / magazine proprietor short of a crossword setter (and with money to spend) please contact me!

<h3>The Format</h3>

<p>These crosswords have been generated as html files,  using bits and pieces of software I've put together myself.  Their format is fairly concise,  particularly compared to using image files for the grids.  (I haven't written any neat Applets for doing the puzzles on-screen.)  The next step will be to use XML files,  hopefully  giving greater control over rendering and improved portability.

<h3>Printing</h3>

<p>If you wish to print the crosswords,  please observe the following points -
<p class="point">Adjusting Text-Size in your browser will affect the size of the grid as well as that of the clues.  Please check via Print Preview that you have a desirable setting before printing.
<p class="point">Most browsers are set to not print backgrounds.  Under this setting,  the shaded cells of the crossword will not be printed as shaded,  although they should be marked with gray squares set inside the cells.  To change the setting:
<p class="point2">In Explorer, look under "Internet Options" in the "Tools" menu.  Then go to the "Advanced" tab,  and about 2/3 of the way down the list you'll find the Printing option "Print background colours and Images."
<p class="point2">In Netscape or Mozilla,  go to "Page Setup" under the "File" menu or from the Print Preview.  The "Print background..." option is on the "Format & Options" tab.

<h3>Cryptic Crosswords</h3>

<p>At the most general,  cryptic crosswords are merely crosswords where the clues are 'cryptic' or indirect rather than literal.  Ideally this is extended to any sort of creative way of hinting at the answer,  although in practice various standard types of clue are usually used.

<p>Usually a clue contains some sort of literal hint at the answer - perhaps an obscure synonym or an example - and also a constructed clue which somehow describes the spelling of the word.  This may be by providing an anagram (with a word like 'arranged' or 'strange' attached; eg 'Wild west food' for 'stew') or a combination of words which are combined to form the answer (eg 'sew around in tissue' for 'sinew'.)  Other standard tricks are hidden words,  with the answer embedded in the clue (sometimes backwards, as in 'Hero returned from Vietnam tables' for 'Batman') and alternate letter clues (such as 'With no fat, even at the inn' for 'thin' - take every second letter of 'aT tHe InN').  A clue may also be two different (obscure) literal clues combined,  (such as 'expensive sweetheart' for 'dear') or just a riddle.

<p>There are many interesting websites where you can learn more about cryptic crosswords - see the link on the previous page.
