NOTES

The key to the puzzle was of course the long quotation attributed to 9-Down...

9-Down. One who did (16-Down), until his blood was (21-Down). (1.1.7)

The answer was "J.F.Kennedy". 
(16-Down was "preside", 21-Down was "spilt") 
His long quotation at 7-Across etc. was 
 
	"Ask not what your country can do for you;
		ask what you can do for your country."
 
The remaining clues...

17.  on drugs = "using" sounds like "you zing"
22.  "whenever" reversed (rollover) minus some letters (returning selections),  vaguely &lit
