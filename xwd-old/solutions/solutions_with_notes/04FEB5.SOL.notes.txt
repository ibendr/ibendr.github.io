8.   sounds like "boss",  bos = genus of cattle
11.  back "bonk"
13.  back "snug liar"
16.  AU (gold) + TO + MATE
18.  M + EAGER (US spelling of meagre)
19.  SO + LO
20.  anag. "snub"
21.  RECONNAISSANCE minus CON
24.  ORE in CS

50.  BEAT + RI + X

Down

1.   anag "ask"
2.   AN + US (apologies for the language)
3.   anag "too poor"
4.   anag "ape"
5.   heart of "c(ARE)s"
6.   N/A and "na" as spoken rough "no"
7.   leaders "To Imitate Maori"
8.   BUG + BEAR
9.   anag "nose"
10.  in "cro(SSR)oads",  reference to Georgia,  formerly a Soviet Socialist Republic
12.  back "moore lob" minus "om"
14.  (John) Lennon,  sounds like "Lenin"
15.  heartless "gau(dy not tou)che", &lit
17.  cut short "monetary"
22.  RAM in ASHES without E
23.  remove each fourth ("forth" we hear) from "ari(d) zon(e) a",  and state of US town Phoenix

30.  puzzle theme = Phoenix = PHOEN (anag "phone",  hence "bad call") + IX.  The subsidiary indication here I would normally consider way too indirect,  but  with the number of cross-references to this clue and other contextual hints I was pretty tempted to give no clue at all here.

47.  half of "cha cha"
