NOTES

Across

1.   DEMISTS = "(presumably) blows hot air at",  gutted  "dem(olition)ists"
5.   T + RIPPED
9.   ERA in "th(e ra)nge of history" &lit
10.  T + RAPPER = game gainer
11.  CRAVATS = accessories,  even letters of "a car, halve a stash"
12.  SQUARE THE CIRCLE (figures "square","circle" about article "the") as ancient mathematicians tried in vain to do,  that is to devise a way of constructing pi (circumference of a circle of diameter 1) relative to a given unit by classical geometric means (straight edge & compass drawing),  just as for instance the irrational square root of ten can be constructed as the diagonal of a 3x1 rectangle.  It not only proved to be impossible,  but was later proved to be impossible.
13.  STEROID  = type of chemical compound (includes oestrogen),  anag "diets or"
15.  SPARRED = lightly boxed, "spa" + "RR" (Rolls Royce) + "ed"
17.  SNOWING = alps' downfall (so sorry about the misleading upper case & misplaced apostrophe), "s" (second) + "No" + "wing"
20.  WAY + WARD
23.  NEEDS FINE TUNING = has wayward reception (of radio, TV, etc.), = isn't quite there yet (of idea, invention)
24.  TRIDENT = missile, "ride" in "TNT"
25.  LABIATE = plant with labiate leaves (mint, etc.),  anag "Bali" + "ate"
26.  LEE = downwind,  back "eel"
27.  RIG + IDLY
28.  DARKENS = shades,  "ark" in "dens"

Down

1.   DETESTS = can't stand, central "E(de)n" + "tests"
2.   ME + A + SURE = bar (music)
3.   SUPER-SONIC SPEED = over mach one (reported "over mark one"), "su-ed" about "person" + "ic spe" (crushed "spice")
4.   SERATED = rough,  odd letters "spear was trendy"
5.   TACKERS = kids (little ones),  = those who tack posters
6.   IMAGINARY NUMBER = (eg) Zillion (not a specific quantity),  mathematically = a multiple of i, in other words the (not real) square root of a negative real number,  hence "not a real square ... having one"
7.   PRANCER = Santa reindeer,  "PR" about anag "crane"
8.   DISTEND = bulge, anag "did nets"
14.  T + ON = big score (cricket etc.)
