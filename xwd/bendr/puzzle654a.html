<h2>This is an "alpabetic jigsaw" puzzle. There is exactly one <em>answer</em> starting with each letter of the alphabet, indicated by the index letter/s of the clue. You need to solve the clues AND work out where they go in the grid. If you'd like the 'normal' version of the same puzzle, it is <a href="puzzle654.html">here</a>. Capital letters in parentheses are cross references to other answers. </h2>
