 <h3> Ben's Cryptic Crosswords</h3>
<h4 style="color:#cc0000">
A fresh cryptic crossword puzzle published here every Wednesday!
</h4>
<h4>
This week's puzzle...
	<a href="puzzle700.html">June 29 - Lean Curd
	</a>
	<br>
	Sounds like a recipe both odd and unkind...
	<!--A couple of birthdays of sorts-->
<!--	This week's puzzle continues an annual tradition... I made the grid, but the clues were contributed by my fellow participants in the Clue For The Day contest on the Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cryptics">"Cryptic Crossword Society"</a>.-->
	</h4>
<!--
<h4>Another Alphabetic Jigsaw puzzle. If you like these, look for past puzzles with names that mention or hint at "A,B,C".
	<br>
	And if you don't like them, you can do the <a href="puzzle654.html">regular (non-jigsaw) version of the same puzzle here</a>. <br>
	(Or, if you want an easier puzzle, you could refer to both.)
	This week's puzzle doesn't have a theme as such, but does mark a few milestone birthdays.
	This week there is also a hint of a theme,
	marking the anniversary of a name change.
	relating to an historic anniversary.
	Although this week there is an extra twist!

My puzzles are cryptics in the English style, somewhere between
Fairfax (Age / Sydney Morning Herald) and Guardian in difficulty.
Hopefully about right for those of you who (like me) favour the
Friday Fairfax or Monday Guardian. Hence my intention to publish
puzzles on Wednesdays.
</p><p>
These days my puzzles are nearly always themed, usually marking
significant anniversaries of historic events, or sometimes clusters
of milestone birthdays of well known people.
</p><p>
My style is more conventional than it used to be (I may republish
some of my more outrageous older puzzles one day) but
there may still be the odd deviation from the rules - so if you're
a real stickler for convention then prepare to be offended!
</p><p>
I am writing in Australia, and some references will be local.
I prefer British to US spellings, and usually put some qualification
in the clue if the answer is the US spelling. For instance,
"COLORS" might be clued as "American shades...".
</p><p>
One unusual touch of mine - I like to give the puzzles individual
names. Largely because my numbering schemes are all over the place!
</p><p>
 All puzzles on this page are my original work.
 If you would like to contact me, feedback is always welcome.
 My email address is:
 <span class="reveal" onclick="this.innerText='';var el=document.createElement('a');el.innerText='i.ben'+'dr@gma'+'il.com';el.href='mailto:'+el.innerText;this.appendChild(el);this.onclick=null">
 (click to reveal)</span>
 </p><p>
 I also wrote the crossword interface myself. It's all in javascript,
 and is available as a forkable project here on gitHub.
 </p><p>
 If you enjoy my puzzles, the greatest way to show your appreciation
 (other than to give me a job, if you happen to be a newspaper proprietor)
 is to pass on a link to anyone else you know who might also enjoy them.
 Just right-click on the link above to one of the puzzles,
 select "Copy link address" and then you can paste it into an email
 or a post on social media.
