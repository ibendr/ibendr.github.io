Gary Alexander Neville (born 18 February 1975) is an English football pundit, former player, and co-owner of English Football League club Salford City. As a player, Neville was a right-back and spent his entire career with Manchester United, serving as club captain for five years. He is one of the most decorated English and European footballers of all time, having won a total of 20 trophies, including eight Premier League titles and two UEFA Champions League titles.[4]


Natalie Jane Imbruglia (/ɪmˈbruːliə/ im-BROO-lee-ə, Italian: [imˈbruʎʎa]; born 4 February 1975) is an Australian singer-songwriter and actress.

Born and raised in Australia, Imbruglia became widely known in the early 1990s playing Beth Brennan in the soap opera Neighbours. After leaving the series, she moved to the UK and began a singing career. Her debut single, a cover of Ednaswap's song "Torn" (1997), quickly became a worldwide hit, topped the US Billboard Radio Songs Chart for eleven weeks in 1998, and was listed on the 50 Best Songs of the 1990s by Rolling Stone.[1][2] Her debut album, Left of the Middle (1997), was a commercial success, certified multi-platinum in the US, the UK and Australia and eventually sold seven million copies worldwide. Subsequent albums, including White Lilies Island (2001) and Counting Down the Days (2005), did not match the commercial success of her debut, but both albums still gained Gold certification in the UK.[3][4] As of 2021, Imbruglia has released six studio albums and has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.[5] Imbruglia has received various accolades, including eight ARIA Awards, two Brit Awards, one Billboard Music Award, one Silver Clef Award and three Grammy nominations.
