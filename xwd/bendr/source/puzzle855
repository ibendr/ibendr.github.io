The Dublin whiskey fire took place on 18 June 1875 in the Liberties area of Dublin.[1] It lasted a single night but killed 13 people (from alcohol poisoning), and resulted in €6 million worth of damage in whiskey alone (adjusted for inflation).[2] People drank from the 6 inches (15 cm) deep river of whiskey that is said to have flowed as far as the Coombe.[3] None of the fatalities suffered during the fire were due to smoke inhalation, burns, or any other form of direct contact with the fire itself; all of them were attributed to alcohol poisoning from drinking the undiluted whiskey running through the streets that had been stored in casks that exploded; this alcohol was much more potent than whiskey offered at retail in bottles.[4]

Origin
The fire is believed to have started in Laurence Malone's bonded storehouse on the corner of Ardee Street,[5] where 5,000 hogsheads (262,500 imperial gallons or 1,193,000 litres or 315,200 US gallons) of whiskey were being stored to a value of £54,000 (equivalent to £6.58 million in 2023).[6] The exact cause of the fire is unknown, but it is known to have started between 4:35 pm when the storehouse was checked, and 8:30 pm when the alarm was raised. At 9:30 pm the barrels within the storehouse began to explode with heat, sending a stream of whiskey flowing through the doors and windows of the burning building.[6]

Spread
The stream of whiskey first stretched down Cork Street, turning onto Ardee Street and catching a house on Chamber Street, then continued farther to Mill Street where it quickly demolished a row of small houses
