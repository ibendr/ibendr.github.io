On March 3, 1875 (149 years ago), the first recorded indoor ice hockey game took place at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec.[1] Organized by James Creighton, who captained one of the teams, the game was between two nine-member teams, using a rubber "puck". Members used skates and sticks used for outdoor hockey and shinny games in Nova Scotia, where Creighton was born and raised. It is recognized as the first organized ice hockey game.
