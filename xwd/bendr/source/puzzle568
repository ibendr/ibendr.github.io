#CFTD 2019_11_03 CFTD Christmas is coming!

As Christmas approaches, I am looking to repeat what I did last year - which seemed to work pretty well - and make a crossword clued entirely (or as close as possible) by CFTD entries. I have filled a grid, which like last year is a very dense grid which I used my software to fill - I couldn't possibly have done it manually! Inevitably, there are some pretty obscure names in there, and I have done a (rough) first step toward researching what some of them are. The grid was designed to give us a BIG list of words all of length 7 (along with some 3s) to make solving the clues a bit more challenging. So today, please clue for any of the words / names in the following list. IF you don't wish to have your clue used in the final published crossword, please indicate this. (Or if you're happy to have it used but don't want your name in the attributions.)

Usual rules... please only post as many clues as how many people have already posted (counting yourself). Do take the time to appreciate other people's clues.

After the first six hours, BONUS likes will be awarded if you are the first to clue for any entry on the list. This rule will hopefully help get all our words clued, as well as level the playing field a bit for later contestants. (The bonus will increase in value as time goes on.)

Ben Robinson I'm not generally keen on so many names either - especially obscure ones (or modern pop culture celebrities), but with such a dense grid (if you look at last year's one linked above, you'll see what the grid looks like) it's very hard to have much control over what goes in. Not helped by the fact that I prepared this one in a bit of a rush.

Roy Leban Ben Robinson This is obviously debatable, but I'm with Araucaria on this one. One of his most famous clues was simply [of of of of of of of of of of (10)], and that inspired this clue. I think a charade like this has to be special (and I think this one is) to not have a straight part. Even without the list of answers above, I think this clue is easier than Araucaria's.

Ben Robinson Has to be THISTLE... although I can't help seeing it as "THUSTLE" (the arrow looks somewhat like an 'implies' sign), which would be more like a New Zealand-Scottish emblem. :) (Not an actual criticism... in fact the implies sign would not be closed at the butt of the arrow.)

Ben Robinson I've just discovered that "Esteban" is not the surname of the major pop-star that I thought it was (which turns out to be "Estefan") but is the stage name of a somewhat less famous musician, Stephen Paul (and the first name of various other people of relatively minor fame).
