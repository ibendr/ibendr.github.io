#CFTD #2021_02_13

I find it interesting that my last two winning CFTD clues have been telescopic clues (a.k.a. "hidden word" clues), as indeed a lot of my well received clues are. I am quite a fan of this form of clue, which I read many years ago described in dismissive terms. Indeed I think I came across a "rule" that one should not include more than two in a puzzle because they are supposedly "too easy". I often defy this rule as a setter (I had five or six in my last puzzle!), and I often prove the "easy" description wrong as a solver, finding that one of the last unsolved clues in a puzzle I'm tackling turns out to be a telescopic! I find that there's something extra head-slapping about the penny-drop moment when I realise that the answer was literally right there before my eyes all along.

For today's contest, we will focus on the telescopic form, BUT I will add some caveats so as to not make things too easy for the solvers. (I might like to resist the idea that it's the easiest type of clue around, but if you know it's coming it really does risk being a bit too simple!)

- We will include some variations on the form...
	- reverse telescopics
	- "phonetic telescopics" (where the answer is embedded in the fodder in sounds rather than in letters)
	- telescopic combined with alternate letters - answer is every second letter of a section of the fodder (forwards or backwards)
	- indirect telescopics - I'm not sure how legitimate this type of clue is, but for instance Steve Allen's clue for "veal" in yesterday's game alluded to the word being embedded in his name. I think this is one where possible issues of fairness are balanced with level of difficulty/obscurity. In the case of Steve's "veal" clue we could see his name above the clue, giving us a fair chance. In contrast, my ridiculous clue of the previous day for "Gore-Tex" as a reverse hidden word in "Exeter-Ogee" which was only referred to in the clue indirectly ("form of total hip-replacement") would have to be considered pretty unfair!
- Try to be a little bit imaginative with indicators, but do still make sure you use them and that they are defensible
- Use obscure and interesting target words. An "easy" clue type provides a good way to make a clue solvable even when the solver doesn't know the word being clued, and such clues provide a nice educational element unique to cryptic crosswords.
- For more familiar words, use original and/or misleading definitions.

I won't hold the game up any longer trying to think of good examples illustrating the above ideas at this point - I may throw som in as #nfc clues once the game is under way (if the inspiration comes). For now, let's get under way...

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. As well as wonderful long telescopics (old and new) we saw some really game exploration of the boundaries and enthusiastic embrace of new ideas. I couldn't have been happier with how it all went. As sometimes happens with a high-participation game, I made a rod for my back when I figured I'd compile all the 10+ scores for the leader board. There were pretty much a score of such scores! I've listed two marvellous reruns that garnered much appreciation, but after them we find Nicholas Loader's touching Valentine's day sentiment, with astute appraisal of fellow CCS member Steve Allen built-in...

(#nfc #rerun) 10 + 10 - Ramki Krishnan - Dressing up in Marseilles, I annoy a mademoiselle (10)
(#nfc #rerun) 9 + 9 - Anirudh Sahni - Embattled wards now deny harboring renegade fugitive (6,7)

9 + 6 - Nicholas Loader - Sweetheart, Steve Allen, tiny bit outspoken? (9)

8 + 6 - Victor Rupert Williamson - Looking back, footballer, Ed Nicholson kidnapped one who lost a shoe? (10)
8 + 6 - Seismal M C Lachlan - I, Amy, our fat herpetologist hid Vader's secret (1, 2, 4, 6)
10 + 4 - Mark Wright - It's very far from here to Mercury and back (6)
7 + 7 - Jay Greenwich - Reflective measures yield some promo on lights on a table (9,6)

8 + 4 - Alec Macaulay - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt has detailed solution to this clue 
7 + 5 - Aldreb Sarabia - Simon T. Hill smuggling for 30 days, maybe? (5)
7 + 5 - Alec Macaulay - Cardinal often covering up (5)

6 + 5 - Guruswamy Nataraj - Surely God - no maiden has to give this back! (7)
8 + 3 - Mark Wright - Smith&Sons Ltd. Supplies Manual. (5,2)
7 + 4 - Mark Wright - Johnny Cash's boy with Back In The USSR (3)
7 + 4 - Sabitha Satchi - Heard during speech, extensive reviews (6)
9 + 2 - Aldreb Sarabia - Hidden agenda's objective? (3)

6 + 4 - Victor Rupert Williamson - May perhaps, be eaten by Simon T. Hill? (5)
7 + 3 - Sabitha Satchi - Editorial on Donald’s city (6)
8 + 2 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - Slimy character regularly appeared in Marx's oily outflow (7)
7 + 3 - Neha Bhandari - Poem penned by Kate Doyle standing on her head (3)

So Happy Valentine's Day everybody, and over to you Nicholas!

#CFTD #2021_02_08

SUPERBOWL SPECIAL

I watched the entire game today, even keeping half an eye on the rather lacklustre half time entertainment. In a desperate bid to gain some benefit from this foolish expenditure of my time, I will draw upon the arduous experience for today's theme...

Please clue for any word or expression associated either with American Football in general, or the NFL or the Superbowl or today's game in particular. BUT DO NOT use the related meaning for your definition. So you could clue for Tampa Bay, but as a place not a football team. Words like ball, helmet, and drive will of course be easy to find non-football meanings for, whereas other expressions like goalpost, linebacker and Mahomes might not work so well.

For those of you who "really aren't into that sort of thing", please note that YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW (OR LEARN) ANYTHING WHATSOEVER about the sport, nor by participating in today's game need you be seen as endorsing it in any way. You may indeed take the opportunity to implicitly express your disdain or disapproval by making clues for expressions that YOU associate with the game, such as "senseless violence", "commercialism", "cultural imperialism" or just "boring".

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Other than a couple of lovely reruns from SSv Avtaar which he did the right thing and marked #nfc, here were the top scorers...

8 + 7 - Saurabh Upadhyay - Spooner purchased a duck at 25% off! (11)
7 + 6 - Neha Bhandari - Quietly left Italy aboard ship before start of severe hair problem (5,4)
7 + 3 - Jay Greenwich - Invalid beginning to let out stale farts. (5,5)
7 + 2 - Simon T. Hill - Crime seen (7)
8 - Jay Greenwich - Bronx dump even Jack might pop out of. (3)
5 + 2 - Simon T. Hill - Should spread out to make yourself look bigger (8,4)
5 + 2 - Sarsa Parilla - Salary mishap becomes desperate play needing divine intervention? (4, 4, 4)

Saurabh Upadhyay's first place clue seems a bit fudgy... on the one hand it follows the stated rule by not using a football definition, but on the other hand I'm not convinced that the definition used exists in real life as a meaning of "quarterback". I guess surely someone somewhere sometime has used it that way in a gimmicky sales promotion! Anyway, I shan't agonise over it... my attitude is that people take these things into account when they vote for a clue, and this one got the votes. (I notice that apparently I voted for it myself before I started having doubts!) So now that I've used all the time-outs and appeals to the video referee and the two-minute warning, we can finally get to the end of the game - go to victory formation Saurabh Upadhyay, and take it away for the next contest!

#CFTD #2021_02_03

I feel a bit bad about winning the last CFTD with a piece of vulgar slang that may suggest a certain amount of disrespect for, or objectification of, women. So to make amends, let's make today's game about TRAILBLAZING WOMEN. Not necessarily women famous for campaigning for women's rights (although that's okay), but I'm more after women that went ahead and achieved in fields that were male dominated in their time and place in culture. Female writers and warriors, scientists and assassins, monarchs and ministers, ... Any females that pushed boundaries and extended the possibilities.

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

#CFTD #2020_01_16

I just noticed Vinay Singad's clue for "Gabba" on the main CCS page. (I didn't think I'd be alone among CCS members keeping an eye on the test match there!) For today's game, please clue for TEST CRICKET VENUES around the world. As usual when I set a theme, you are NOT required to define the answer via it's themed meaning, and in fact I generally encourage people to use a different definition where available. As colourful as the some of the ground names are, not many lend themselves to an alternative definition, so another way we could make our definitions more interesting would be to allude to a specific aspect of the ground (although this will mean solving starts to get tricky for the non-cricket fans) such as a nickname (e.g. "home of cricket"), or where it is (try to be a bit subtle), or a piece of its cricketing history (e.g. "location of tie", "where Don said goodbye with a duck"). One way or another, please try to mostly avoid such a straightforward and generic definition as "cricket ground" or "test venue", although of course married to the right word play, something like "test site" might work very well into a surface reading.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Test_cricket_grounds

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#nfc (host)

LORDS

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. We had a lovely range of clues, and a diversity of names at the top of the leader board...

14 + 7 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - Home of cricket in London (original renamed "Dorset Square", early on) (5)
10 + 4 - Lata Muthanna - Our Ben resolved to acquire new bar in Mumbai stadium (9)
8 + 5 - Saurabh Upadhyay - We thanked timeless shot at India's Cup victory location (8)
9 + 4 - Simon T. Hill - Some bowling and hitting must aid movement of Indian pitch (6,7)

Rhiannon's clue was, I believe, a worthy winner, not only using the distinctive "home of cricket" tag for Lords but also incorporating some more interesting information about the ground in the word play. As host, just the sort of thing I was hoping to see! Over to you Rhiannon...

#CFTD #2020_01_04

I like how people often base the next theme on something evoked by their winning clue. So in that spirit, today's theme is POLYGAMY or other words relating to "alternative" relationship (and/or intimate) arrangements. By alternative I mean anything that challenges the prescribed norm of a sexually-exclusive heterosexual lifelong pairing. So SAME-SEX MARRIAGE and SERIAL MONOGAMY are both variations from this norm and so could be clued for. Likewise LOVER, MENAGE-A-TROIS, OPEN RELATIONSHIP, etc. Even CELIBACY is an alternative, although frankly it sounds rather unexciting to me.

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Good to see not only lots of nice (and witty) cluing, but also plenty of appreciation shown for one another's work. Here are (I think) all the clues that scored 10+ ...

13 + 11 - Sarsa Parilla - Brief affair by solitary bedside table, perhaps (3, 5, 5)
15 + 9 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - A bicycle built for steering clear of marriage (8)
12 + 4 - Samit Kallianpur - Self-control in a bicycle manoeuvre (8)
9 + 5 - Sarsa Parilla - Kinky Paulo Seixas loves brains over brawns? (11)
7 + 6 - Jay Greenwich - He’s well-groomed! (10)
8 + 5 - Martin Coops Cooper - Introducing others for group sauciness explains relationship preferences using third characters. The three of them are happy together! (8) 
8 + 4 - Monty Green - Sort of relationship producing stomach acidosis? (15)
10 + 2 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - Almost half of uprisings brought about by an intimate friend (5)
6 + 4 - Viswanathan GK - Lover travelled to Romania (9)

Rhiannon was just pipped by the late DD entry from Sarsa Parilla, with the help of my usual tie-splitting rule of favouring the later posting. And I do like an occasional bit of furniture. Well done everyone and over to you Sarsa Parilla!

This week's new puzzle at Ben's Cryptics, "Confused Narcissist", is my annual tribute to the Clue-For-The-Day competition at FB's "Cryptic Crossword Society" page. Each year I compile a grid and then set a CFTD game using the words. I then use a selection of the clues players compose (attributed) to make the final puzzle. This year's edition has a hint of a theme, with the answers helping complete this comment about 2020...

2020: 2 1 25 of 30 4, 9A, (with a 6 of 5D), having ignored the 26 of the 28 12, and not 21 the 17 for 27 of 29 20, or the pleas of the 8 24 5A movement, or the 13 of society, lurched from 3 hearings to 11 in 18 22.

#CFTD #2020_12_22 #End_of_Year_Special

I've now made a grid for my end-of-2020 clued-by-CFTD puzzle. We had a few of the words in a previous contest, but most are new. Please clue for any of the entries listed below. If you are going to cross reference other answers in your clue (this is encouraged), you can use the numeric reference. e.g. if you were to define TRUMP with the phrase "he had [IMPEACHMENT] hearing" you could write it as "he had 3 down hearing" or just "he had 3 hearing" (since there is no 3 across). Note that BLACK, LIVES, MATTER are all present: 8 down 24 down 5 across. (I want them clued as separate words, but they may be referred to as a phrase in a clue, say for GEORGE FLOYD).

Across:
   1. EGOIST (6)
   5. MATTER (6)
   9. TRUMP (5)
  10. POSTNATAL (9)
  11. DEFEAT (6)
  12. PANDEMIC (8)
  15. REINHARDT (9)
  17. SOBS (4)
  18. FREE (4)
  19. MANGO LEAF (5 4)
  22. ELECTION (8)
  23. CALLAO (6)
  26. RUINATION (9)
  28. COVID (5)
  29,20dn. GEORGE FLOYD (6 5)
  30. BASEST (6)
Down:
   2. GRUFF (5)
   3. IMPEACHMENT (11)
   4. TYPE (4)
   5. MISCASTING (10)
   6. TON (3)
   7. ESTIMABLE (9)
   8. BLACK (5)
   9. TUDOR (5)
  13. DISSONANCES (11)
  14. TRAMPOLINE (10)
  16. ISRAELITE (9)
  20. see 29 across
  21. HEARD (5)
  24. LIVES (5)
  25. KNOB (4)
  27. AIR (3)

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

EXTRA RULE: After you have posted THREE clues, from then on try to only clue for words that no one has clued for yet (as of when you start thinking about it... if someone posts one in the meantime it's OK, still post yours.)

#nfc #host
Django unchained her in Trad (9)
Entirely legal event canning 9 across, introducing our new beginnings (8)
Launching egregious legal efforts, claims 9ac: its outcome's nefarious! (8)


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. A power outage here somewhat delayed the wrapping up! We've seen games where the extra 'laugh' reactions have put a funny clue into the winning spot. Today it was nice to see some 'care' reactions push two clues to the top - along with each of them getting the 5 point bonus as late clues for George Floyd. In fact, Rhiannon's particularly touching contribution takes the win. Since it is nearly 2am down under, I suspect we will have a few hours hiatus before the sequel appears.

Top scores...

5 + 7 + 5 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - Tragically go free, godly one rendered breathless (6,5)
5 + 5 + 5 - Simon T. Hill - One who took a knee, illegally and sadly in 2020 (6,5)

9 + 3 - Joel Hess - Best meal I cooked - worthy of praise (9)
11 + 1 - Simon T. Hill - Kind of city people (4)

5 + 1 + 5 - Joel Hess - Troublesome edge of glory for a fallen victim (6,5)

5 + 3 + 2 - Simon T. Hill - Could be voiced with no energy... (I hope you don’t get this!) (5)
7 + 3 - Neha Bhandari - The most deplorable recast as best (6)
7 + 3 - Aldreb Sarabia - Primarily Chinese origin virus/infectious disease (5)

6 + 3 - Neha Bhandari - Organs save royal beings (5)

Congratulations, and over to Rhiannon.

#CFTD #2020_11_03 Presidents of the USA

Rarely have the eyes of the world all turned so nervously toward the USA as they do now. (I don't think we were quite as nervous about Trump in 2016 because for the most part we still didn't really think it could happen.) For that matter, rarely has so much hope for deliverance been invested in one dotty old doofus devoid of charisma.

Today, please clue for the surname of any US president OR phrase containing such ("Adam's apple", "Taylor series"), BUT DON'T define it via the president. There are a only a handful that double as common nouns (e.g. Grant, Bush, Ford, he-who-must-not-be-named) so with the others you will mostly still need to define them via a person (or place, etc.), but just NOT the president. e.g. you could clue "Washington" as the city, "Garfield" as the comic cat, "Hoover" as the appliance, or you could clue for "J Edgar Hoover" of FBI fame, or clue for the band "The Crazy World of Arthur Brown" (there was a president Chester Arthur).

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. There were some amusing clues, and indeed laughter was the winner today, with the bonus points for laugh reactions pushing three amusing clues into the podium positions. It was very close among those three (13, 13, 12) and in fine electoral tradition to select a winner I had to go all the way to the Supreme Court (and pull in a favour or two from my dodgy brother as the governor of Florida)... by dint of getting her score later in the game (my actual tie breaking rule) Suzie wins!

7 + 6 - Suzie Lambert - Penetrate hunk with last finger inserted (6)
8 + 5 - Saurabh Upadhyay - It sucks to hang around without love (6)

7 + 5 - Sudha Bhaskaran - Initially big ugly snails hovered around shrub (4)

9 + 2 - Jay Greenwich - Run through recipe ingredients. (6)

Congratulations everyone and over to you Suzie.

#CFTD #2020_10_02

More birthdays ... my research tells me that the following five famous folks celebrate 50th or 100th birthdays this month (albeit posthumously in the case of the centenarians). Please use any of these people as the theme for your clues today. You may clue for a first name or surname or full name (not necessarily by reference to the person) or clue for something to do with their life, field of endeavour or achievements, sayings, etc. OR write a clue which refers to them or alludes to part of their life or career in the surface. The boundaries of this are a little vague - as usual I won't wade in and decree clues to be sufficently relevant or not ... I will leave that up to the audience. (i.e. if you don't think a clue fits the brief, don't vote for it.)

8 - Harish Kamath - Trump, for example, is a quiet incumbent (9)

As usual, I like to decide ties in favour of the later-posted clue, which gives the win to Sabitha Satchi. Well done and over to you for the next game!

#CFTD #2020_09_28

Today let's tear down some statues, metaphorically speaking. Clue for an historical figure that you think of negatively in some way - whether as outright evil, or merely weak or incompetent or foolish, etc. (We don't have to agree!) Make it someone from the past - I think we've already managed to whack Trump a few times already. :) AND PUT THE BOOT IN! i.e. try to make your surface capture some of your negative impression of the person. BUT do NOT simply use your lowly opinion of the person as your definition. That's too easy, and arguably not really fair as a definition shouldn't really be based on an opinion. You may still use a definition that is negative, e.g. "mass murderer" if that is objectively true of the person, but ALSO try to tailor your wordplay to contribute to the effect, and ideally with some humour.

THREE STRIKES ... First of all, to keep things manageable (we really would like people to read and appreciate most if not all of the other clues) today I will decree, as hosts sometimes do, a MAXIMUM of THREE clues per setter. And for today's theme, a bit of a choose-your own: you must choose a particular word (your "keyword"), preferably an interesting one, and use that word in each one of your clues. It should appear in exactly the same form in each clue: no synonyms, no different declensions. DON'T put all your clues in one post - we're still going to be judging them individually, not as a set.

“I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and queen: moult no feather. I have of late, (but wherefore I know not) lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition; that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o'er hanging firmament, this majestical roof, fretted with golden fire: why, it appeareth no other thing to me, than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man, How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, In form and moving how express and admirable, In action how like an Angel, In apprehension how like a god, The beauty of the world, The paragon of animals. And yet to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seem to say so.”

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation.  I have been distracted most of the day and haven't had a chance to really monitor the game. I'll just trust that clues have followed the rules and present the results as I can see them...

11 + 7 - Rommer July Domingo - Turn furious writer slightly wet (6)

11 + 5 - Brian Dungate - Turn against the government due to pact being broken (4,5)

12 + 2 - Nicholas Loader - In bad taste, say? (5)

7 + 6 - Cherie Maharam - Laid-back poet talking about hot drink (5)
11 + 2 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - Oddly rickety, inherently poetic (5)

6 + 6 - Steve Allen - Off-putting? (15)

9 + 2 - Cherie Maharam - Rain too severe for talking (7)
6 + 5 - Sarsa Parilla - Perhaps a scourge of lunar eclipse (3)

Nice to again see a lot of different setters on the leader board - Cherie being the only repeat I see in the top 8 (well done Cherie).

I was very tempted to bestow extra host's-prerogative points on Brian's clue, which as it is made it into 2nd place despite only being posted in the final few hours. While I congratulate him on that effort (and a very nice clue indeed) I hesitate to deprive a relative newcomer of the win with a rule they might not have heard of yet! (But be warned ... it can happen!)

So once again, it's over to Rommer July Domingo to host our next game.

#CFTD #2020_08_25

Today you may clue for any word or phrase, but you are required to use a name of an active CFTD participant IN YOUR CLUE. (Not in the answer, although that may also occur.) By 'active participant' I mean EITHER a CCS member who has posted in CFTD within the last week or one who has participated extensively in the past. You may use their first or last (or other) name, or their full name. It may be serving any legitimate role in the clue. It could be part of word play as fodder for anagram or telescopic or acrostic (although that's a bit easy) or even as part of the cryptic instruction (not many names will work for that ... Bash springs to mind as a potential anagrind). It could be part of the definition, BUT if you are relying on information about the actual person (e.g. "Debbie's occupation") then it should be something publicly visible on their profile.

Scoring: like=1  laugh/love/cry=2,  wow=3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation... a veritable torrent! Here, as far as I can tell, are all the clues scoring above 8 as of when I checked them. Please, if anyone spots a higher scoring clue that I've left off, do comment below - and I will adjust the results IF SIGNIFICANT. (Keep in mind that clues sometimes get a reaction or two after the host has inspected - I'll only bother to edit if I've missed out ones near the top of the leaderboard.)

Scores given as total reactions + extra points

#CFTD #2020_08_02

MONOPOLY won the day in the last game, so lets hone in on the topic of that classic board game. (Those unfamiliar will doubtless find relevant resources online.) Please clue for words relevant to the game, including names of properties OR words taken from them (e.g. "bow" from "Bow St") as well as other related words (e.g.  "chance", "jail", "community [chest]", "hotel", "dice", "mortgage") or the playing pieces from various editions (Dog? Hat? I can't remember what they are - we didn't have them in our ancient kit). You may take words from different editions of the game, not just the London based original.

IMPORTANT: Your DEFINITION should NOT relate to the game. You clue an entire property name like "Trafalgar Square", but define it as the location (and refer to a specific feature of it, e.g. "where famous column stands") rather than as a Monopoly property.

Scoring: like=1  laugh/love/cry=2,  wow=3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation... here are the top scores:

13 + 1 - Tejas Siddharth - I gloat about having a drink and face severe consequences (2, 2, 4)

10 + 2 - Roy Leban - Vehicle going back and forth? (7)
12 - Sarsa Parilla - Some let him bless with a small metal cover (7)
11 + 1 - Debbie Manber Kupfer - Genuine Earl Grey, I hear, is an asset (8)

11 - Brian Dungate - Ex-PM just offered a venue for country dancers (7)

I'm also giving a special mention to Brian Dungate for his charming clue relating to "Whitehall 1212" once upon a time being the phone number for the police. When I first moved to my current town, most of the shop hoardings still had the phone number for the business given as only the final 4 digits, harking back to a time when one would call via a named exchange. ("Warburton 2020"). By that time we actually had 6 digit numbers instead, but everyone knew that all the Warburton numbers started with 66 so there was no need to clutter the signs with the extra digits.

But our winner by popular decree is Tejas who is off to the lockup for bragging about a beverage, and now faces the severe consequence of having to host the next game... congratulations and over to you!

#CFTD #2020_07_13

We are approaching the 50th anniversary of the legendary ISLE OF WIGHT music festival of 1970. Drawing an estimated 600,000 people it well surpassed Woodstock in scale, and oddly enough the English weather was kinder!

Please clue for anything to do with the festival - in particular acts that performed (see link). *BUT* if your clue is for a band or artist, please do not simply use something as obvious and generic as 'band', 'artist', 'performer' etc. as your definition. EITHER use an alternative definition (where possible - e.g. DOORS, WHO), or allude to something specific to that band or performer. As examples, for JETHRO TULL: "Thick as a brick, performers..." in reference to the famous album, or for JIMI HENDRIX: "Guitarist who showed up God" in reference to his (since dramatised) legendary encounter with Clapton.

Scoring: like=1  laugh/love/cry=2,  WOW=3!

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight_Festival_1970


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. The actual anniversary is still a month away. I have a themed puzzle in the production line but haven't yet written the clues... there's some food for thought for me here!

Today's top three...

9 + 2 - Julian Curwin - Fair representation of last five (8) FESTIVAL
10 - Samit Kallianpur - He played drums for my generation and tossed the kimono (5,4) KEITH MOON
8 - Antonio Sarmiento - Fever played without its central character, at no charge (4) FREE

Well done all round and over to the winner, Julian.

#CFTD #2020_05_23

Earlier this month saw her 200th birthday (I think we have had a nursing-related CFTD to mark it), and today we are going to further celebrate by making clues for words taken from the name "FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE". Your word must be formed from a SUBSEQUENCE of the letters in that name, STILL IN THEIR ORIGINAL ORDER. So it's not as wide open as being able to use any word at all made from the letters.
To put it another way... Some words occur whole in the name, like LORE, NIGHT, or GAL. You may certainly clue for any of those. But you may also clue for any word you can get just by deleting some letters. e.g.
FRENCH:   F(lo)RENC(e nig)H(tingale)
RETINA:   (flo)RE(nce nigh)TIN(g)A(le)
ORIGINAL: (fl)OR(ence n)IG(ht)IN(g)AL(e)
But you can't reorder the letters, so for instance RAGE would not be allowed, since the only A in the fodder has no G after it. Likewise FAIL is no good. The only 'A' coming so late definitely limits the possibilities.

Scoring: like=1  laugh/love/cry=2,  wow=3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS Thanks for everyone's participation... with a huge log jam of clues scoring 5 or 6 I won't list all these worthy runners-up, but cut to the chase and announce that Victor Rupert Williamson has just pipped them all with 7 votes for the neat little clue "Dark blue thing? (5)" ... all yours!

#CFTD #2020_05_15

[Optional long winded intro...] Meaningful names... I sometimes think we English-speakers have an illusion that people's names having meanings is somehow peculiar to *other* cultures. It's a kind of movie cliche for a foreigner to introduce themself with their name and its translation. In the wonderful satirical movie "Top Secret" the East German lass explains about her name Hillary "It's a German name. It means 'she whose bosoms defy gravity'." Asked what his name means, Nick says "Oh, nothing. My dad thought of it while he was shaving." Which sort of illustrates my point: when we hear the name "Nick" we don't connect it to the word "nick". (Fair enough perhaps since it's usually short for Nicholas etc.) But more broadly, I think more of our names than we realise have meanings as everyday words or their close relatives.

TODAY'S GAME -> clue for a word (NOT as a name) harvested from among the NAMES IN YOUR FAMILY, translated into English as appropriate. Exception: DO NOT CLUE FOR "JOHN" MEANING TOILET. (I just get a bit tired of that one.) How far you have to reach into your extended family, and how much liberty you need to take in "translating" will of course vary according to what's available. If you're from a Smith family with siblings Harry, Ruby and Rose you'll have an easy time of it. For me I would have to look to some cousins' names and/or do some adaptation - I could pluck the robin from my surname, or for my brother Andrew I could go to the etymological root of that name (Ancient Greek: ἀνήρ/ἀνδρός aner/andros) and clue for man. Feel free to tell us about the family member (and original name if translated) if you like to share, pay tribute etc., but this is in no way compulsory!

#RESULTS 
Thanks for everyone's participation... it was nice to see people sharing the origins of some of their loved ones' names. I'm not sure whether I made the task description as entirely clear as I might have, and in fact I found myself 'liking' a couple of clues which did clue the name as a name rather than cluing a word that the name translated to. At least I made one thing clear enough... I was particularly pleased to see a complete absence of lavatorial clues! The top three scorers certainly all fit the bill...

11+4 - Martin Coops Cooper - Magic wand reveals her crack (4)
6+1 - Dan Kramarsky - Hidden figures all yearn to come forward. (5) (Hi, Mom!)
5+1 - Neha Bhandari - Terribly rue arrest of financial officer (9)

And lest we all be branded as childish gigglers at gratuitous rudeness, I'll assume that Martin's (easily) winning clue appealed via a wide range of possibler interpretations - a magic wand which detects flaws in statues ("Yes, master, your Venus statue looks wonderful, but I'm detecting a weakness near the top of each arm...") or perhaps enables us to appreciate the subtler jokes from a comedienne. (As to the more obvious interpretation, there are times when an imperfectly attired overweight gentleman bends over that people observing from behind wish for a magic wand that might un-reveal a crack...)

So good game everyone, and over to the warlock who confines a small motor car...

(And do watch that movie "Top Secret" if you get a chance - it's chock full of comedic goodness and layers of delicious satire.)

#CFTD #2020_05_05

Flavour of the Month... some of you will have noticed that the puzzles I publish each Wednesday (at https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/index.html) are mostly themed puzzles marking various historic anniversaries. Researching them has proved to be very educational for me! Sometimes that anniversary is of some famous person's birth (e.g. https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/puzzle585.html), although more typically I will lump together a handful of people with milestone birthdays in the same month (April 2020: https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/puzzle586.html).

Today, clue for famous* people with milestone* birthdays in May 2020. You may clue whole name, or just surname, real name or performance name or other moniker - just so long as your clue is fair... the more obscure the answer, the more pointed your word play and/or definition should be.

*"famous" is obviously a matter of degree as well as of opinion. I leave it to your judgement, and to the judgement of your peers who will be casting the votes! Similarly with "milestone" - obviously 100th and 50th are bigger milestones than 60th or 35th... it's up to you where to draw the line, and I suppose there are cultural variations in rating their importance. If turning 87 has enormous significance in your culture, perhaps add an explanatory comment so we appreciate this.

Scoring...
 like : 1
 laugh / love / cry : 2
 wow : 3
 random new emojis FB comes up with : ???

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

---

#RESULTS

Firstly, my apologies for being an almost entirely absentee host. A few real life distractions going on at the moment... hopefully I'll have time to read and enjoy some more of the clues tomorrow. It looks like reactions were quite light on for the second half of the game, so I suspect I'm not the only one who hasn't read them all!

In hindsight, if I wanted the 'milestoneness' of the birthdays to be taken into account for judging, I perhaps should have asked that people comment on the age of the person after each clue. In any case, as someone who has long advocated a shift to a base 16 number system (which can be read as base 4, or in turn binary), I can fully appreciate 32 as a significant milestone for Adele to be celebrating, and it is Nat Rengasamy's very neat little telescopic clue for her that took first place (with daylight second):   Singer made leather bags (5)

Thanks for everyone's input, and over to you Nat!

They say that if you're a serviceable bass player, your employment prospects are helpd if you can sing a bit...

According to the "seven year itch" theory, after seven years of being married to the same person, you start to feel like a bit of a change. It turns out seven years of being single has a similar effect.


I've been watching this "challenge" ping around friends and family for a while wondering how long before someone dobbed me in... you've probably all seen it by now and know the drill... ten albums that influenced me, without commentary (I might have to adapt that bit) over ten days, and nominating someone else each day (thinking of ten people might be harder than thinking of ten albums for a notorious hermit like me!).
Day 1 ... this album cover is completely unfamiliar but going by the track listing this was the album I grew up with (on a taped copy)...
Louis Armstrong
(Damien Flynn)

Day 2 of the "albums that influenced my taste in music" challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas).
Today I nominate David Goding... whose extensive and eclectic collection probably includes at least 100 favourites he'd be happy to share... but sorry, David, just the ten required over ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!)
Meddle

Day 3 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas).
Today I nominate Nira Quinn, whose fantastic range of musical skills suggests an interesting range of influences. Post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!)
Essential Hendrix

Day 4 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas).
Today I nominate Graeme Cameron, who was himself a significant influence on my musical tastes, and who has continued to explore new and interesting territory. Post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!)
Thick as a Brick

Day 5 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas).
Today I nominate Jason Krah, a fellow teeming with interesting ideas - they must have come from somewhere! Post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!)
In the Court of the Crimson King

Day 6 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas).
Today I nominate Dan Pelosi... what I know of his tastes so far being pretty hard to fault. Post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!). Today's selection falls foul of Facebook's standards (and potentially offends a lot of folks in fact), but I think you can be permitted a restricted portion of it...
Blind Faith

Day 7 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas). Today I nominate Andy Jordan. Post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!).
Deep Purple Live in Japan

Day 8 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas). Today I nominate Gabe Buller, although surely someone already has? Another friend of mine in the UK has cheerfully embarked on a third round of participation, and I reckon Gabe could go through a lot of sets of ten albums and still be giving us all an education. Post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!).
Band of Gypsys

Day 9 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas). If the 'challenge' was to maintain the discipline to actually remember something ten days in a row, then it looks like I'm gonna have it licked. However, if the challenging element is to respect the "no commentary" rule and say nothing about your favourite albums when sharing them with others, these last two days will be my downfall! I just have to say a few things about this one...
(i) probably the only reason "The Wall" didn't make my ten, despite the enormous regard I have for that entire multi-media project, was wanting to avoid excessive repetition... I already had one early Pink Floyd album, and I was going to have to include this Roger Waters masterpiece. (Hendrix also got a bit of a double run.)
(ii) following on from an earlier discussion, this album for me more than any other uses the space available with modern crystal clear production to really give us some detailed textures and awesome overall soundscapes, all without feeling crowded with too much action
(iii) the use of spoken-word story telling set against fantastic mood-setting music ... not sure I've heard it done as well anywhere else
(iv) the messaging ... about religion and about capitalism ... right on point and creatively achieved, with Roger's signature dark humour
And today I nominate Bec, who has long been a great sharer of interesting music... post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!).
Amused to Death

Day 10 of the challenge (I was nominated by Judd Zekas). Today I nominate Suz Rogers ... it'll be interesting to hear what music appeals to a visual  Post ten "albums that influenced your taste in music" in ten days: album covers only with no explanation or commentary (although that seems to follow!).
My final posting ... (I ceased to obey the no commentary rule as of yesterday) have I saved the best for last? Or is this just the most recent one to have a big influence on me? Well, a bit of both. As someone who has dabbled in DIY multi-track recording over the years, I appreciate how much more demanding it can be in terms of getting everything tight and clean. And when you work solo, you're not pooling the creative ideas of a range of people with instrument and genre specialisations - so it's easy to end up playing similar bits on all the instruments. Well, this superbly talented and original young musician from my neck of the woods doesn't seem to have much trouble with either issue. This solo album bursts with original ideas - exotic harmonies, innovative arrangement, intriguing melodies, and at times some startling (and perhaps challenging) aesthetic choices - which is to say I know that not everyone will like it! But if your tastes extend to the experimental sounds of King Crimson, Genesis, Pink Floyd and other prog rockers, and you appreciate some great playing along the way, then you've really got to give this a go (at https://superdensecrushloadfactor.bandcamp.com/album/words-cant-say)...

#CFTD #2020_04_11

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars

I've just been on my FB feed ... trawling through the trolling ... getting annoyed at racist ranting against the Chinese that has flared up during this pandemic. I was likewise frustrated with much of the glib media coverage of the Hong Kong protests last year. Much of this sentiment seems to overlook the often brutal historical wrongs China has suffered at the hands of western powers over the course of history. (I do hope, as China cements its place as the next global superpower, that revenge is not an intrinsic element of their philosophy!) So in the interests of promoting some more knowledge of the Middle Kingdom's history, today let's make clues relating (in answer OR surface, hopefully often both) to THE OPIUM WARS. Countries, people and places involved, campaigns, key events. If you clue for a term indirectly relevant (e.g. "Bengal") it would be good if your definition highlighted the relevance to the theme (e.g. "Where the Brits grew opium for the Chinese trade").

I may expand the theme later in the contest.

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for the participation from those that found the time. Clearly the extra work required to research the topic didn't suit everyone, and perhaps the weekend offered other sources of entertainment. There were some well-worked clues here, and several that had me going back to the literature to find an answer or explanation... just the sort of educational cluing I was after! Here are the top scorers...

7+1 - Javeria A Khan - Anti-pig civil war in China (7,10)
4+3 - Sudha Bhaskaran - UN to squeal top off, iterates about the agreements not being fifty-fifty say (7,8)
6+1 - Sanket Shrivastava - How tempura is cooked may be of importance in Asian culture (3,5,4)
6 - Bharati Shankaran Hemmady - Father gets speedy resolution for what could become a bloomer (5,4)

Special mention goes to two late clues from Nicholas Loader which missed most of the action. These were both elaborate constructions that impressively built word play from relevant thematic elements, the second one indeed an &lit. I wouldn't want to include too many clues this hard-wrought in a puzzle, but when you're encouraging the solver to engage with a topic, a couple of key theme clues like this can be very effective.

Nicholas Loader - Forced to cling to opium by a tad brutally, aside from that, even dirty violent negotiation from Britain (7,9)
Nicholas Loader - Silent form of pressure from the East, not using a copper, to gain the end of drug trade with English, essentially, given first to the Queen (3,3,3,6)

So Javeria takes the prize, and I am also intrigued by her as-yet-unsolved clue that followed her winning entry. I'm sure all will be revealed soon... Over to you Javeria!

#CFTD 2020_04_02

I am moving totally in the opposite direction from Ben’s challenge and putting up one of my favourite verses from my favourite author - Haruki Murakami. You can clue for any word in that verse including the authors name or his books. Have fun. No math puzzles in this one. Clue as many as you like as often as you like. 🙂

Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.

An you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.

And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.
- Haruki Murakami

#CFTD #2020_04_01

Let's get old-school... I was reminded by the activity on another thread today of a time way back when I first joined CCS, when the normal format for CFTD was to have a single given word for people to clue for. So the only "puzzle" for the reader is to work out the annotation (which, like a solution, they then post in reply to the clue). As I commented the other day, this was more favourable to tricky clues. But it also meant an extra disadvantage to those late on the scene, as good ideas for word play could be exhausted by early contestants. Hence my "bizarre new clue limit rule"...

Today's contest: clue for the word   OVER (4)

BIZARRE NEW CLUE LIMIT RULE: the number of clues from any one participant should not be more than the SQUARE ROOT of the total number of clues. So once there are four clues (or yours is the fourth) you can have two of them. But you can't post a 3rd until there are 9 all together, or you could have 4 out of 16 or 5 out of 25 etc. [ So even if you don't bother engaging with everyone else's clues, you'll at least have to count them! Although it wouldn't hurt if someone commented the total from time to time. ]

Scoring: like=1  laugh/love/cry=2,  wow=3

Usual other rules - read/annotate/like the other clues, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS. It looks like the sudden drastic narrowing of possibilities didn't completely destroy the game - it was heartening to see such enthusiastic participation, and interesting to see some of the creative forms of word play people came up with. And thank you for coping with the arithmetical challenge built in! Camelia seems to have hit a nerve with a certain clerical preoccupation in two of her clues which secured the top spots, comfortably overtaking earlier postings. A man of the cloth reading might be starting to feel a bit hot under the dog-collar. Here are the top 6 clues...

16 + 5 - Camelia Oberoi - Priest taken aback after love ended (4)
11 + 4 - Camelia Oberoi - Conclusion - only virgins excite religious leaders (4)
10 + 3 - Monty Green - We hear the eggs are finished (4)
10 + 2 - Samit Kallianpur - More controversial content? (4)
11 + 1 - Martyn Hardy - Are voters somewhat turned off? (4)
9 + 1 - Martyn Hardy - Signifying end of communication in radio version (4)

Well done everyone, and over to you Camelia!

#CFTD #2020_03_29

[ rambling intro ]
Today we're having a DOUBLES TOURNAMENT... it's OK, I'm not putting you all into pairs and making you work together like some cruel reprise of that particular school / university nightmare! Allow me to explain. We often discuss the inbuilt bias against clue posted later in the game on CFTD, but recently I was reflecting on another bias in the game. Like clues that come in late, really challenging clues can also be at a significant disadvantage. Firstly, if they go unsolved for some hours then they are only going to start earning likes from when the answer is revealed, giving them the same time handicap. Also, more subtly, people only tend to like a clue after they have fully parsed it. And while I like to think most of us make the effort to go through other people's clues and try to understand and appreciate them, this is often done with limited time available and a lot of clues to read. So inevitably, on any given day, some of the potential likers of clues will be skimming a bit and not stopping to mull over the more ponderous creations, resulting in really subtle clues not being givin their full due. [ As an aside to an already ballooning rant, this was probably an advantage to the style of game we used to have where we had a single word to work with each day - so we started off knowing the answer to every clue and only had to work out how each one was obtained. ] Today I would like to run a game that rewards the more challenging (but fair) clues, but rather than revert to a single-word game, I am going to go quite the other way...

[ here's the actual game ]
For each entry, you need to write TWO DIFFERENT clues for the SAME word or expression. Put both clues in one posting, on separate lines if you can. Your two clues should both be quite tricky, so avoid really obvious definitions (especially if the word play is straight forward). Try to use a different type of word play for each of the two clues, and use two different definitions which don't obviously match each other. For instance, if cluing for "game", don't use the definitions "match" and "contest", but something like "brave" and "rubber" would be OK.

When judging - please reward clues that are _cleverly_ difficult and quite valid - sound constructions with good misdirection etc. The sort where you really enjoy the penny frop moment and say "oh yes that does work!". As opposed to clues that are difficult because they are faulty - using flawed substitutions or sloppy choices of indicator etc.

like = 1 , laugh/cry/love = 2 , wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. There were some quite thoughtful clues here, with some nice CDs as well as original word play construction. I think Ananth's top scoring pair posted early in the game hit the spot really well, both clues being quite subtle with clever surfaces, and so I am happy to declare him today's winner.

#CFTD #2020_03_23

Well I thought everything was OK and my life wasn't going to be particularly impacted by that pesky virus I'd been hearing about... but then all of a sudden THEY STOPPED THE FOOTBALL! Now it's serious. With lots of things on hold, today let's clue for the word "BREAK" or any of its synonyms (via any of its numerous meanings - whether as noun or transitive or intransitive verb, and keeping in mind specialist meanings).

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues (like=1, love/laugh=2, wow=3), no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and above all be nice and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation! I hope the game provided a break from something. Here are the top results, with scores indicating base score (total reactions) plus bonus (extra for stronger reactions) plus * (an indeterminite number of "host's prerogative" votes) for Bash's late clue that I thought worthy of promotion to the leader board...

11+2 - Cherie Maharam - Harried priest offers sample of Ecclesiastes for deliverance (7)
7+4 - Nat Rengasamy - China to stop the spread (5,3,5)
9+1 - Neha Bhandari - Broken hearts conceal final torment and ruin (7)
3+3+* - Bash Ashok - Break from the job of digging a grave? (12)

Well done all, and over to you Cherie!

#CFTD #2020_03_16

"Your Enumeration!" Today, we are going to clue for phrases of at least two words. But here's the tricky bit (you knew there would be a catch!)...

You must choose a phrase whose enumeration CONTAINS that of your name _as_it_appears_here_on_facebook_. So for instance, as my name is Ben Robinson (3,8) I would have to clue for phrases which contain a pair of consecutive words with lengths 3 and 8 (the phrase may be more than two words). So I could clue for...
THE BULLETIN (3,8) (a newspaper), or
OLD CHESTNUT (3,8), or
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS (4,4,3,8) or
LET THE CHILDREN GO (3,3,8,2) (a song)
...basically I just need ...3,8... to appear somewhere in the enumeration - but they must be adjacent and in order! Not (8,3) or (3,2,8).

So that it's not outrageously tough on those of you with more than two parts to your displayed name (Rhiannon and Victor spring to mind), you may choose any sequence of two lengths from your name. E.g. Victor Rupert Williamson (6,6,10), you may use (...6,6...) or (...6,10...), so you will in fact have more options than the rest of us! (So Rhiannon you can use 8,6 or 6,4; Martin 6,5 or 5,6; Javeria 7,1 or 1,4)

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#RESULTS 

Sorry about the late finish, I've been busy today. Awesome participation, and I hope I can find time to read and enjoy all these clues! There seemed to be plenty of clues scoring 7 or 8 in total (loves/laughs are 2, wows 3 in my current scoring), but here are the top four, with Ramki and Bash breaking away from the pack...

16+5 - Ramki Krishnan - How to make ten girls get money? (5,8)
15+5 - Bash Ashok - A bird that's completely distressed? (4,5)
6+4 - Seerat Hazir - Blimey, working a virgin’s upper half on top of you and me can cause infection! (6,5)
7+2 - Victor Rupert Williamson - Ulterior motive - dad had engine repaired (6,6)

It would've seemed appropriate for Ramki's sterling effort to earn silver, but it did just a bit better and took the gold! Over to you Ramki!

WWW	XXX	OOO	MMM	WHEEE?	...?

#CFTD #2020_03_13

[ Opinions on these matters welcome... ]
Recently I was reading about the German spelling reforms of 1996 (see link below). Two things surprised me - 

(a) they DIDN'T take the opportunity to ditch the Eszett (ß), an anomolous character which in my opinion could easily have been systematically replaced by double 's', although they tweaked rules around its usage.

(b) they made changes that result in the occurrence of _triple_letters_! Specifically, compound words formed from a word ending in a double letter followed by a word starting with another instance of that letter _used_ to have those three letters shortened to two, but the reforms aim to make the spelling more logically consistent and keep the triple letter in the compound word. Behold the glory of -

Die Flussschifffahrt - ("River Navigation")

To celebrate this novelty, today clue for expressions (which will mostly involve multiple words) which contain three of the same letter in a row (albeit broken by a space between words), such as "MASS SHOOTING" with three "S"s in a row. There will be some onomatopoeiae or initialisms that are single word, but I'd most like to see people tracking down the "hidden" triples in phrases, titles, names, etc.

I'm going to shift from my usual approach and adopt the popular choice of giving extra reactions more score - 2 points for love/laugh and 3 for WOW. I will also run with the 5-clue-per-setter maximum, which I think helped getting more voting happening on the clues submitted yesterday. Otherwise, some usual rules - read/solve/like the rest of the clues, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. be nice and have fun!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography_reform_of_1996

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation! It was nice to see some imaginations being stretched to find suitable expressions for the contest. Here are the top scorers (remembering 2 for love/laugh, 3 for wow, and later clues favoured in ties) -

14 - Bash Ashok - Angry way to scratch using a needle in a particular manner (5,6)

11 - Smith John - How to tell someone to go away barefoot (4,3)
11 - Drew Quinn - A lot could be one foot tall! (3,3,5)
11 - Javeria A Khan - Representative of angry neighbourhood (5, 7)

10 - Dan Kramarsky - Just a couple of pieces of fruit and a bowl, or maybe a pair of shoes. Even so, it beats dying! (5, 4)
10 - Mona Sogal - Political thriller misrepresented aimless son (4,6)
10 - Seerat Hazir - Unoccupied starship is good for the capitalist economy (4,10)

Please clue for any of the words from the poem (at least 4 letters). You can use different POS of the same word (e.g. clue for STRETCH instead of STRETCHES) but no synonyms.
Same rules as always. No more clues than there are players in the game, if your clue remains unsolved give a hint or the solution, be generous in appreciating other clues (likes get 1, loves / wows get 3)

Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee

#CFTD #2020_03_01

[If you want, you may skip the rambling introduction paragraph and go straight to the game description... ]

As a lot of you are aware, I have a keen interest in India since spending a sizable chunk of my childhood there. Indeed I lived in Delhi during Indira Gandhi's Emergency, the _last_ time someone took serious steps towards dismantling the nation's democracy (although I was much too young to understand the politics at the time). When I last visited India in 2011, I spoke to various Muslims I met (admittedly in the southern part of the country where the dynamics are a little different to the North), and came away with the impression of a largely harmonious multi-faith society. I took great heart, feeling that the long journey since the horrors of the partition - despite some hiccups along the way - was close to reaching its destination, the peaceful inclusive India that Mahatma Gandhi worked so tirelessly for. It is with genuine grief that I see that dream unraveling today, with the almost expired embers of old enmities being dug up and fanned into new life. I'd like some positive sentiments to grasp at, so...

Today please clue for any of these words:

HOPE, HELP, LOVE, PEACE, UNITY, HARMONY, RESPECT, JUSTICE, PROGRESS, HUMANITY, SECURITY, INCLUSION, COMMUNITY, TOLERANCE, REDEMPTION ... and synonyms

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun and spread the love and hope!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Many nice clues, as well as positive reactions, have indeed cheered my day. I especially enjoyed people's efforts to make clue relevant to the current situation, and in this respect I think both of Ramki's top two clues really excelled, so I am happy to agree with the voting and declare him the winner.

#CFTD #2020_02_06

Recently when setting a puzzle in the alphabetic-jigsaw format, I tried a slight variation in the approach to writing the clues, which was to ignore the first letter in the word play of the clue. (In that format you know the first letter anyway.)

Today, please clue for any word which starts with the first letter of your name *as it appears here on facebook*. (e.g. Victor would clue for 'V', regardless of what his first name might be in real life.) If you have adopted the moniker "X-word Master", then bad luck you're lumped with 'X' as your first letter! *BUT do not include this letter in the word play part of your clue.*

Examples - I would clue for words starting with "B"...

Hit with a new girl (4)
BANG
anno: [B] A N G

Note this essentially rules out CDs, but DDs are still possible, as long as one definition (thought of as the word play) is for the word that's left when you remove the first letter...

Boast trashy newspaper (4)
BRAG
anno: brag = boast, rag = trashy newspaper

A single definition *could* work as long as it defines the word with or without the first letter. [ this could be because both word means the same thing (example ayone?), or because two readings of your definition are possible, one describing each word. ] In this case it's effectively an &lit.


Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

With my site (unlike others last I checked), it is possible to do these on the computer even though it's a bit clunky, and it's still better to jot down answers you've solved but not yet fit to the grid. If you prefer, you can tackle a "normal" version of the same puzzle here: https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/puzzle575.html (You may notice it's the same URL with the 'a' removed from the puzzle number, a convention I will stick to from now on.)

#CFTD #2020_02_03

Yesterday I undertook one of the most gruelling challenges of sports appreciation... I watched the entire SUPERBOWL (final of the AMERICAN FOOTBALL aka GRIDIRON) between the SAN FRANCISCO FORTY NINERS and the KANSAS CITY CHIEFS from start to finish _in real time!_ I even sat through the NATIONAL ANTHEM and took in the HALFTIME SHOW, featuring SHAKIRA and JENNIFER LOPEZ. (And I didn't turn the volume down!) Today please clue for any of the words highlighted above. Or, if you can be bothered doing theresearch (or are already familiar enough) any other words to do with the sport generally or yesterday's game in particular (e.g. key people involved). But, IF you clue for terms or names that are likely to be unfamiliar to non-aficianados, please try and make a clue that said non-aficianados will have a fighting chance of solving with a bit of inspired guesswork.

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!


Closed, results coming... Meanwhile, a follow up to my opening anecdote - having conquered the viewing challenge of Superbowl early in the day (it started at 10:30am here) I got overconfident, and went on to attempt a three-hour Bollywood movie (2002 Devdas) which came on the TV starting at 11pm. It was not without it's charm, but given the timeslot proved a challenge too far... I'll just have to look up the ending!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. I think it was fun to drag us all into an exotic realm... regardless of geography it seems that not many CCS folk double as hard core American Football fans! I have exercised some host's discretion and promoted a few clues onto the leader board (indicated by *), being the last two posted, and an earlier one by Dan that went unsolved despite being second clue posted and nothing unfair about it - just a lovely subtle construction. I didn't add a specific number, because none were going to knock off Camelia's wonderfully appropriate clue for Shakira, which had me ululating with delight. (Well not really, but if I was a more expressive type perhaps.) I'm not sure if it's a blow against ageism that a 43 and 50 year old performer can still be put on a pedestal as sex objects, or a sad blow against feminism, a reminder that you're never old enough to escape body-image expectations! Great clue anyway.

9+++++ - Camelia Oberoi - Singer to shake endlessly, primarily with incredibly round ass (7)
7 - Samit Kallianpur - Period of rest for me? (8)
5 - Samit Kallianpur - They cook outside India for commanders (6)
4+ - Ananth Srinivasan - We rise to this, an oath .. in lament, in revolt (8,6)

2+** -  Dan Kramarsky - For second half, city score doubled. (5)
3* - Victor Rupert Williamson - Barcelona to film a different game? (8,8)
1* - Roy Leban - It’s 6 points made by Reverend Heerhugowaard, for example (9)

So well done everyone, and over to you Camelia!

Clue for FAMOUS FEMINISTS (have we done this before? feels like we should have!).

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation... and for the illumination - I have a few new names to look up and learn about now. I suppose part and parcel of being a famous feminist is that you don't get to be very famous. (That said, some folks got a mention whose fame is probably greater then their feminism. Interesting to see different takes on what constitutes a "feminist".) At the top of the leaderboard, appropriately, we see one of the (several) dynamic empowered women of CCS, with Camelia securing the top two spots, broken only by Faten's nfc clue (is it a rerun?). I especially liked the terseness of the Emma Watson clue. Here are the top results, with '+' used to indicate stronger reactions (love/wow/laugh)...

13+++++ - Camelia Oberoi - I lost my head to a rather crazy flier (6,7)
(11+ but nfc) - Fa Ten - She fought for women and made great stuff possible in the end (11)
10++ - Camelia Oberoi - Rebellious woman tames actor (4,6)
10+ - Josh Ahearn - Author said "No to hug! I'm back and part of a pack!" (5,4)
10+ - SSv Avtaar - She fought aggressively, jerking horse, to start with, in a sari for liberation ultimately repelling introduction of Raj (4,2,6)
9+ - SSv Avtaar - A non-upper class Zulu of Malaysia initially attacked fanatically -'she is a breath of fresh air for a new generation (6,9)
9 - Cherie Maharam - Senior brought to battles! (3,9,1,1,1)
8++ - Camelia Oberoi - Prime minister of a country embraces royal soldier, having a broken hand (6,6)
8+ - Ananth Srinivasan - Satisfies fun mom & kinky suffragettes (6,9)

Congratulations, and over to you Camelia!

#CFTD #2020_Jan_03

Now we've done 2020 vision, what can we do about 20/20 cricket? (Ignore it and watch a proper test match, I hear you say?) Today let's clue for variant forms of sports. For instance: twenty-twenty cricket, two-touch football, wheelchair tennis, matchplay golf, etc. I'm sure people will know many more, relevant to the sports they follow.

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#RESULTS ... Thanks for everyone's participation.

Top vote winners ...

8 -
Victor Rupert Williamson - Safe dive I used in this sporting variant? (4-1-4) or (4,1,4)
6 - 
Claire Louise Clark - Pals intended playing a net sport (6,6)
Dan Kramarsky - E.U. legal title passes to underage U.S. baseball players. (6,6)
SSv Avtaar - Excruciating bellyache with bout of vomitting initially gets everyone - it is quite commonly seen on  seashores (5,10)

Some of the later clues may have deserved more votes than they got, but I didn't feel any really surpassed these four early postings, and in fact Victor's winner was last posted of the four.

So congratulations and over to you Stew...

#CFTD #2019 #December_30

[ :) You may skip this rambling intro -> ] Recently I realised I had always taken for granted that "Tory" was short for "Conservative", somehow overlooking the fact that, well, it just isn't. Perhaps the word "conservatory" was lurking in my mind muddying the waters. In any case, I continued to assume that it was a "-tory" suffix truncated from a longer word like "mandatory" or "signatory" through some historical connection. However, I was surprised to learn that it came from a term for Irish brigands, originally used as an insult by the Whigs during the Exclusion Bill crisis of 1678–1681. For that matter "Whig" was initially an insult from "whiggamore", a cattle driver).  [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tories_(British_political_party) ]

For today's contest, clue for any word that has a curious or surprising etymology, wherby our understood meaning today (e.g. "Tory" = Conservative) is different to the original meaning when the word was formed ("tory" = Irish bandit). BUT! Here's the twist: to give solvers a challenge and make it educational for all of us... for the definition part of your clue, use the OLD meaning of the word.
Example:

Try to embrace love of Irish bandit (4)

As per example, it would be good if your clue is easy enough to give solvers a sporting chance without knowing the meaning used. (If the definition was better known, I would usually prefer to make the word play subtler, e.g. by at least substituting "attempt" for "try".)

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#RESULTS

Thanks for everyone's participation... and once again apologies for absentee hosting. Australia's fire situation became more serious overnight (yesterday's 40C+ temperatures and 40-90km/h winds were always going to spell trouble) and I'm keeping a close eye on a number of locations where people I know may be affected. As such, I'm afraid I haven't even made time to read all the clues, and will just call this one by the votes...

11 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - Left sibling eating at home (8)
10 - Dan Kramarsky - Shake a nine-quart vessel held for forty days. (10)
9 - Iis Venky - A ball of yarn like this one, perhaps (4)
7++ - Joel Hess - Little rodent sounds like seafood (6)
6 - Claire Louise Clark - Rock music, ultimately noisy (5)

It looks like Rhiannon has once again proved that you don't always have to be first cab off the rank to take the prize, with her smooth winning clue posted later than any of the others in the top 5. (In fact I believe she has at least once taken first place with the very last clue posted in a CFTD.) Congratulations, and over to you Rhiannon!

“It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the young know they are wretched for they are full of the truthless ideal which have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real, they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of life.”

#RESULTS

So here are the clues that stand on the podium at the conclusion of SSv's Nov 20 game...

20+ - Janet Lazar - Odd characters form a fund, resulting in a scam (5) - FRAUD
16++ - Joel Hess - Fix a municipality’s untruthfulness (9) - MENDACITY
12+ - Lata Muthanna - Sweeten the pot of small spare meal gone sour (6,4,4) GREASE ONES PALM

So I hereby declare Janet victorious and invite her to start the next game. Janet has already let me know that this will be a few hours off yet, so I shall leave the Nov 21 game open for cluing for some time yet.

#CFTD 2019-10-28

After all things wheeled, let's go a different way. For today's contest, please clue for any vehicle that does not rely on wheels. So things that that slide, glide, float or bounce(?) rather than rolling on wheels. (I won't be so strict as to say it can't have any wheels anywhere in it at all... for instance a glider is OK although it probably has some litte wheels involved somewhere in the flight controls, but they aren't a necessary part of making a glider.)

(My) usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, marginal extra credit will be given for love/wow/laugh reactions and ties split in favour of later-posted clue. Have fun!

#CFTD 2019-09-22
I feel a bit guilty picking up the CFTD win yesterday as I barely looked in on the game, being distracted by the unfolding of the pointy end of the season in Australia's own native football code. To be precise, it was Preliminary Final week. So today, let's clue for the word PRELIMINARY or it's synonyms (adjective or noun).

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#CFTD 2019-08-18
With an enthralling Ashes battle unfolding, let's make ASH the theme of the day... specifically, please clue for any word (or phrase) CONTAINING the word "ASH" (not broken up, not backwards). After 6 hours, you may also clue for words containing "RUN" and after 12 hours, "OUT", - with all those unleashed we shouldn't run out of possibilities!

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. have fun!

#RESULTS - the weekend ran out so I was absent for the game ... I trust everyone behaved themselves and played by the rules. :) It looks like the likes favoured those who got in before the weekend petered out (even in you other backwards parts of the world where it holds out a little bit longer). No doubt some fine clues are among the lengthy tail of the game. But anyhow, as for results, it looks like we have...

11 - Ramki Krishnan - Money's just material (8)

9 - David Cadman - Pale, like a chicken (5)
9 - Bharati Shankaran Hemmady - Maybe Keats returns to drink a quiet cuppa here (7)

8 - Cherie Maharam - Car (convertible) took off, got into an accident (7)

Certainly an efficient little clue that's taken the honours... well done and over to you Ramki!

Today, clue for any word (or phrase) that has three of the same letter occuring as alternate letters, such as the three 'E's in 'deleterious'. +2 bonus if the repeated leter is NOT a vowel.
(My) usual rules -
- Find time to read / solve / like other clues (and avoid repeating essentially same ideas)
- Marginal (tie-breaking) extra credit for stronger reactions (wow/laugh/love)
- No more clues per setter than distinct setters who have posted at the time
- Good luck and have fun

#RESULTS

A great flood of clues... fantastic participation thank you all! A shame I have this confounded new thing called a "job" complicating my life and stealing my precious time, so I didn't get to enjoy all the contributions. Looking at the top like-getters, I like what I saw and I was tempted to make up a new bonus on the fly for Vaibhav (who secured the +2 for the 'L's in LA LA LAND but also had the 'A's in there for good measure), but he had reached first place without such improvised adjudication... 

9+2++ Vaibhav Mathur Two gangsters return to lead a network, and coin a film title (2,2,4) LA LA LAND
10+ Victor Rupert Williamson - Place where a parent is hiding behind a dog (7) ALABAMA
8+2 Joel Hess Director's - great desire to split damaged chock (9) HITCHCOCK

#CFTD 2019_07_20 #CYCLING

Since the Tour de France is underway, let's clue for words (or phrases) to do with bicycles and cycling.

No more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, otherwise usual conditions apply... have fun!

#RESULTS

Thanks for all the clues, it's been quite the grand tour. But despite the vigorous peddling, not a lot of appreciation being shown with the likes - a solitary 5 at the top of the game and six clues tying for second with 3 likes each. (I've ranked them in favour of later clues as is my usual approach). So the leaderboard:

5 - Mona Sogal - Cyclist's trousers (5, 7)

3 -
Julian Curwin - Scooter was a sourpuss (5)
Julian Curwin - Moustaches to manage watering holes (10)
John Johnson - One fractured in crash on group ride to Paris (4,2,6)
Chris FA Johnson - Uttered Spanish all right; point taken (5)
John Johnson - Riders need these supports, including the ends of fork and frame (6)
Julian Curwin - Not pole position for the pace setters (7)

Clearly an honourable mention due to Julian Curwin for multiple appearances (matched by the Johnson name collectively.)

Well done all, and over to you Mona!

#CFTD 2019_07_09 ... GREEN

I found yesterday's game had a nice balance of a specific focus but plenty of scope for imagination. So in the spirit of one of my favourite maxims "it doesn't have to be original to be good" I'm going to unashamedly plagiarise Julian's idea and run essentially the same game around the clolour GREEN. Clue for green, things that are green, things that are nick named 'green' (US currency, nausea, certain fresh herbs, envy, ...), or shades of green (olive, teal, ...). Please try to be more imaginative than to use "colour" or "shade" as your definition - e.g. clue "avocado" with a definition relating to the fruit not the colour. AFTER 12 HOURS, you may also clue for any word as long as you use a green reference in your clue.

No more clues-per-person than players already in the game.

Please take some time to read / solve / like other clues.

Good luck and have fun!

#RESULTS

Thanks everyone! Lots of good clues... and according to the likocracy, a cluster of excellent clues and one standout. Here's the top 6:

12 - Sunehri Sadanand - Tavern with merely a drop of dew turns green ! (7)

#CFTD 2019_06_05 - OPPOSITES

Today, each submission should be a PAIR of clues for two opposite words (e.g. MALE, FEMALE or HIGH, LOW.) NEITHER CLUE SHOULD INCLUDE A DEFINITION - i.e. both clues are word play only, and all the solver knows about the meanings is that they are a pair of opposites.

For example...

Cuban leader skinny (5)
Dry it out (5)

BTW - on a PC ctrl-Enter puts a line break in your comment (instead of Enter which finishes and submits it). I don't know how it works on phone.

As usual, give hints or even answers as you see fit... no more turns each than players who've had a turn. 24 hours... let's go

Something from left field today... clue for any word, name or phrase, BUT...
(i) the words of your clue must occur in alphabetical order
(ii) your score in likes will be MULTIPLIED by the length of your clue in words

Amazingly broken down, hesitating totally (11)

A bad case cried dreadfully, prior to unusual visit (10)
recidivist



#RESULTS

Well done to all who braved this challenge. (See what happens when you put the lunatic in charge!) The multiplicative scoring system worked quite interestingly, and here were the results...

likes x words = score ...

8 x 6 = 48 - Neha Bhandari - Blossom for glum inventor of telephone (8)

4 x 12 = 48 - Brian Dungate - Alphabetically: Bradman, Duck, Giovanni, Izetti, Pasquale, Quixote: ... setter, sometimes utterly virile: Who? (3,6)

6 x 6 = 36 - Patricia Sawyer Dad fed mother oil - surprisingly vanilla (6,2,3,4)

7 x 4 = 28 - Ramki Krishnan - A lovable novel, primarily (5,3)

5 x 5 = 25 - Victor Rupert Williamson - A bad carthorse moving players? (9)
