La peinture surréaliste

René Magritte

In 1924, Loeb opened his Galerie Pierre at 13 rue Bonaparte in Paris and presented Pascin's works in his first exhibition.[4] In the gallery's most famous exhibition, La peinture surréaliste (November 14–26, 1925), the first group exhibition of Surrealist painters, Loeb presented works by Hans Arp, Paul Klee, Man Ray, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Giorgio de Chirico, as well as André Masson.
