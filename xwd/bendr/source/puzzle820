The second BOER WAR (Afrikaans: Tweede Vryheidsoorlog, lit. 'Second Freedom War', 11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902), also known as the Boer War, Anglo–Boer War, or South African War, was a conflict fought between the BRITISH EMPIRE and the two Boer republics (the south AFRICAN REPUBLIC and ORANGE FREE STATE) over the Empire's influence in Southern Africa.
The Witwatersrand GOLD RUSH caused a large influx of "foreigners" to the South African Republic, mostly British from the CAPE COLONY. They were not permitted to vote, and were regarded as "unwelcome visitors", so they protested to the British authorities in the Cape. Negotiations failed at the Bloemfontein Conference in June 1899. The conflict broke out in October when Boer irregulars and militia attacked British colonial settlements. The Boers placed LADYSMITH, Kimberley, and Mafeking under siege, and won victories at Colenso, Magersfontein and Stormberg. Increased numbers of British Army soldiers were brought to Southern Africa and mounted unsuccessful attacks against the Boers.
