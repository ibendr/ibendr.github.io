#CFTD #2020_12_22 #End_of_Year_Special
I've now made a grid for my end-of-2020 clued-by-CFTD puzzle. We had a few of the words in a previous contest, but most are new. Please clue for any of the entries listed below. If you are going to cross reference other answers in your clue (this is encouraged), you can use the numeric reference. e.g. if you were to define TRUMP with the phrase "he had [IMPEACHMENT] hearing" you could write it as "he had 3 down hearing" or just "he had 3 hearing" (since there is no 3 across). Note that BLACK, LIVES, MATTER are all present: 8 down 24 down 5 across. (I want them clued as separate words, but they may be referred to as a phrase in a clue, say for GEORGE FLOYD).
Across:

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3
Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!
EXTRA RULE: After you have posted THREE clues, from then on try to only clue for words that no one has clued for yet (as of when you start thinking about it... if someone posts one in the meantime it's OK, still post yours.)
