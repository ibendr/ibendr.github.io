Founded by the National Life and Accident Insurance Company[15] as a platform to sell the company's insurance products, WSM first signed on October 5, 1925.[1][16] The call letters were derived from the company's motto, "We Shield Millions".[17] Studios were first located in the company's building on Seventh Avenue and Union Street in downtown Nashville; this was the original home of the Opry, until 1934.

WSM is associated with the popularization of country music through its weekly Saturday night program, the Grand Ole Opry, the longest-running radio program in history. The Opry began as the WSM Barn Dance on November 28, 1925, with Uncle Jimmy Thompson as the first performer.[18] George D. Hay, a newspaper reporter from Memphis, was WSM's first program director.[19] On December 10, 1927, Hay is quoted as saying "For the past hour we have been listening to music largely from Grand Opera, but from now on we will present 'The Grand Ole Opry'",[19] contrasting the preceding program on the NBC Red Network with WSM's local broadcast
