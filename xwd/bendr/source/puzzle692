"The Popular Science Monthly" first published 1872 by D Appleton & Co.
In 1915, that magazine became "Scientific Monthly" (1958 absorbed into "Science") while selling its name to Modern Publishing, who used it for their magazine "World's Advance" (previously "Modern Electrics and Mechanics") Now "Popular Science" 

From April 27, 2021, the Popular Science publication was changed to a fully digital format and is no longer in physical print.
