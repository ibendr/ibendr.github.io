#CFTD #2021_06_28 - LOCAL ICONS

Let's see some provincial pride, and neighbourly name-dropping! Today please clue for famous people or things that have their origins in - OR are widely associated with - somewhere near you. I'm being deliberately vague rather than specifying "your country" or "your town" ... cast the net as wide as you need to in order to find an interesting subject! As usual, the more obscure your answer (especially if it is a name, with the potential spelling anomalies that come with names) the more you should try to use a form of word play that gives the solver a fighting chance of arriving at the correct spelling even if they don't know it.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2021_06_26 - NAMES with ALLITERATION

Thanks to Victor for an interesting game with the 6-word limit really making us tighten up our surfaces. (I discovered last summer that falling asleep at the beach can also result in tightening up of ones surfaces - I swear the leg I left in full sun ended up with crackling on it. But I digress...) Today's theme will possibly see us straying in the other direction, but I would still encourage people to keep their clues nice and compact if they can.

Today, clue for ALLITERATIVE NAMES (of real life people or things, or ones taken from well known fiction). So, any names where both parts start with the same sound, even if it's not the same letter. (e.g. Clark Kent). (Conversely, same letter is no good if the sound is nt the same - e.g. don't clue for "Saint Sharon" even though both parts start with 's'.) You can go for names with more than two parts as long as they ALL start with the same sound, e.g. Ku Klux Klan.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!



#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Lots of later clues seemed to largely miss out on the reactions, but as we know that's how it goes. Heidi has demonstrated that the power of getting in early is amplified considerably by getting in early with a really good clue!.

Since the one that got me home took us north from Quebec into the Arctic Circle, let's clue for words or phrases to do with that far northern reach of our globe... countries, territories or seas that lie (at least partly) inside the circle, culture, geography, wildlife, natural phenomena associated with the region, etc. Idioms involving these things are also welcome.

#CFTD #2021_06_18

BEES - clue for words or phrases to do wth bees

One of the under-reported big issues of our time is the crisis in apiculture globally. (It's not just about honey!) One of those things that flies under the radar, as the mundane business of food production seems to be of little interest to the western media. Clearly people are more worried about royal babies and celebrity boxing matches than about feeding humanity. So let's all read up about bees and share some new vocabulary and knowledge with one another. (For instance, I just learnt that "apiary" does NOT mean bee-keeping.)
https://e360.yale.edu/features/declining_bee_populations_pose_a_threat_to_global_agriculture
Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3
Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

11 + 12 - Jeremy Bate - Ask one country what bees can do! (11)
9 + 10 - Debbie Manber Kupfer - Male doctor, single (5)
7 + 8 - Alec Macaulay - Queen’s breakfast served up jolly early (5,5)
7 + 4 - Monty Green - Honey Hoffman - UK artist in hiding! (6)
6 + 4 - Monty Green - He-Man poetry about insects (11)

Thanks for everyone's participation. Sorry for the slight delay in results. There was a concerned raised with me about whether the winning clue was effectively a rerun, which has been a topic of discussion recently. I have looked at some previous clues for the same word on CCS that have used a similar word play, but to my mind the definitions and surfaces were quite different. Indeed, none I saw had used "ask" for "poll" which I think gives Jeremy's clue much of its character, hinting at echoes of JFK "ask what you can do for your country". So I have no problem with awarding the game the way the votes fell, and handing the baton to Jeremy.

PM to Jeremy:
Hi Jeremy. Firstly well done on winning the Clue-For-The-Day contest at CCS yesterday. I'm sorry if the experience was marred either by Chris bickering about the correctness of the clue (and I didn't think his objection made sense really) or by the suggestion that was put to me (and which I reported but dismissed in announcing the results) that the clue was recycled.

Anyway, the convention is that the winner of the day's game gets to host the next game, so although there's been a bit of a delay, you're still welcome to take that on.

But if you don't want to, please let us know and we can keep the ball rolling with someone else posting a game. (If we haven't heard from you soon we'll go ahead and do that anyway.)

BOTHER! Today please clue for words or phrases about things being bothersome, ranging from people or things which peeve (miscreant, pest, brat, parasite, etc.) to things going wrong (problem, issue, glitch, hiccup, fly in the ointment, bug, spanner in the works, SNAFU, etc.) Please stick to words which have (at least potentially) this general meaning, as opposed to specific things which you categorise thus. (For instance, don't clue for "protestor" ... even though you may consider a protestor to be bothersome, the word has not taken on that general meaning. Likewise, "power outage", "child", "red tape" may all at times be frustrating things but are too specific for today's game.)

#CFTD #2021_05_18

Today's theme is CHOCOLATE. Clue for something to do with chocolate, or use a reference to such in your surface. PLEASE make sure that you have read / solved / judged some other clues before jumping in (unless you're first in of course). If you've come late to the game and there are already hundreds of clues, at least go through and read some of them - perhaps go through the more recent ones (to help later entries) and scan the earlier ones for those scoring well and add likes to your favourites.

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS

Thanks for everyone's participation. I must apologise for being a something of an absentee host, as I am doing some granddad-childcare currently. Some of the clues I did have time to read were quite pleasing in various ways. Like chocolate! Here are the top three, with a strong 1-3 finish for Heidi, to whom I now happily pass the baton.

8 + 5 - Heidi Schroeder - Chocolatier’s keen about gold wrapping, fudge and blueberry fillings (7)
6 + 6 - Chris Lissman - First kiss women's underwear for a treat ( 8 )

CACTUS
Thorns are my language.
I announce my existence
with a bleeding touch.
Once these thorns were flowers.
I loathe lovers who betray.
Poets have abandoned the deserts
to go back to the gardens.
Only camels remain here, and merchants,
who trample my blooms to dust.
One thorn for each rare drop of water.
I don’t tempt butterflies,
no bird sings my praise.
I don’t yield to droughts.
I create another beauty
beyond the moonlight,
this side of dreams,
a sharp, piercing,
parallel language.

#CFTD #2021_05_09 #PUZZLES
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle
As seems to be popular these days, I will pivot via the previous winning clue, which was for SUDOKU, to a new theme, which will be PUZZLES. Please clue for any types of puzzle... which could vary from the general ("RIDDLE") to the specific ("SEVEN BRIDGES OF KONIGSBERG"). For famous puzzles which end in the word "puzzle", I think it would be best to omit that word and clue for the rest of the name, e.g. "EIGHT QUEENS". For obscure and/or proprietary names (e.g. names specific to a publication, like "QUIPTIC") please make sure that your word play gives a fair chance of solving even for those unfamiliar. NOTE that I've tweaked the scoring to make a laugh worth 1 point. Sometimes a clue gives me a chuckle, without being a good clue for other reasons - I like the idea of a reaction that gives a point for the humour to such a clue. If it's funny AND good and so you think it warrants two points, give it a 'care' (or 'wow' for three).

Scoring: laugh/like = 1  love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!
