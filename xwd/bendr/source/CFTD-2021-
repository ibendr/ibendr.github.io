#CFTD #2021_12_15

Thanks Sam Zipcat for a good planting game. It was nice to get such a good response to my clue evoking Miss Piggy... I suppose the key ingredient was that it resonated with her character, since she always considered herself worthy of her 'own' show (or thought that the show was built around her). So let's run with that idea...

Clue for whatever you like, but with the surface of your clue about a well-know TV show character, preferably capturing something relevant about their character or role in the show. Example:

Homer's work ultimately too darned lazy... makes Burns be angry! (7)

#CFTD #2021_12_03 POPULAR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE

We all (I hope) have our favourite children's books ... today please make clues for (or surfaces all about) well known works of children's literature and well known characters from them. (You may extend this to strong personal favourites that you feel should be better known, but if the answer is obscure please make sure that the clue is gettable.) I won't make it a rule, but I would prefer to see people favour books that HAVEN'T been eclipsed by major Disney (or other) movie adaptations.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. I hope as well as reliving your own happy childhood (and/or parental) literary memories, you've heard of some new classics to read ... you're never to old for a good kid's book! I've been busy with family commitments - entertaining grandchildren and celebrating a parent - so I haven't actually read all the clues (yet). It appears that these are our top five scorers, with the top four all within a point! As usual, I have decided tie breaks in favour of later posted clues, giving this final order...

12 + 8 - Jamie Thunder - Children's favourite man eating TNT? He's OK, he exploded (6,3,4,6)
11 + 9 - Joel Hess - Sound of the top of a tenor range for a famed Swiss person (5)

11 + 8 - Raj Jayaram - Assenting character, extremely naughty, drinking rum? (5)
13 + 6 - Saurabh Upadhyay - Story of frugal revolutionary [8]

10 + 7 - Heidi Schroeder - “Eek!”, an imaginative collection of poetry for children (5,3,8,4)

Congratulations to all for the many fine contributions, and especially to Jamie Thunder who's lightning wit has rumbled into our group... over to you Jamie!

#CFTD 10/30/2021
Well, tomorrow being Halloween, it's almost obligatory to do something spooky. But let's do something a little less traditional, and celebrate one of the favorite authors of my youth, Edgar Allen Poe, who lived for a time in my hometown of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Most people are familar with his creepy poems (such as The Raven, Annabel Lee, and Lenore) and short stories (like The Fall of the House of Usher, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Pit and the Pendulum, and The Cask of Amontillao), at least in America, where they're frequently taught in the schools. But one of my favorites is the haunted Ulalume, in which Poe returned to one of his most frequent themes, the death of a beloved one. The poem makes ample use of the sounds and colors of the English language, and so is a perfect choice for your challenge: set any word of five or more letters from the poem. One point for likes, two for love, care, or surprise, three for wow. And an extra point for any clue I deem sufficiently eerie or Halloween-like. So a lot of points to be made. Contest will close tomorrow around 4PM Pacific Time. Have fun!
ULALUME
The skies they were ashen and sober;
The leaves they were crisped and sere—
The leaves they were withering and sere;
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year:
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
In the misty mid region of Weir—
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
Here once, through an alley Titanic,
Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—
Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll—
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole—
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole.
Our talk had been serious and sober,
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—
Our memories were treacherous and sere,—
For we knew not the month was October,
And we marked not the night of the year
(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)—
We noted not the dim lake of Auber
(Though once we had journeyed down here)—
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
And now, as the night was senescent
And star-dials pointed to morn—
As the star-dials hinted of morn—
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born,
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn—
Astarte's bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn.
And I said: "She is warmer than Dian;
She rolls through an ether of sighs—
She revels in a region of sighs:
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies—
To the Lethean peace of the skies—
Come up, in despite of the Lion,
To shine on us with her bright eyes—
Come up through the lair of the Lion,
With love in her luminous eyes."
But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
Said: "Sadly this star I mistrust—
Her pallor I strangely mistrust:
Ah, hasten! —ah, let us not linger!
Ah, fly! —let us fly! -for we must."
In terror she spoke, letting sink her
Wings until they trailed in the dust—
In agony sobbed, letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust—
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.
I replied: "This is nothing but dreaming:
Let us on by this tremulous light!
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its Sybilic splendour is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty tonight!—
See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
And be sure it will lead us aright—
We safely may trust to a gleaming,
That cannot but guide us aright,
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
And tempted her out of her gloom—
And conquered her scruples and gloom;
And we passed to the end of the vista,
But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
By the door of a legended tomb;
And I said: "What is written, sweet sister,
On the door of this legended tomb?"
She replied: "Ulalume -Ulalume—
'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere—
As the leaves that were withering and sere;
And I cried: "It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed—I journeyed down here!—
That I brought a dread burden down here—
On this night of all nights in the year,
Ah, what demon hath tempted me here?
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—
This misty mid region of Weir—
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,
This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."

 yes but if you read an Islamic feminist's thoughts on the matter you will get a different perspective ... indeed some Muslim women wear their traditional garb (whichever it may be) against their husband's preference. In the west we have a tradition (lessened happily by some progress in the area I believe) of insisting that women are constantly judged by their appearance, no matter the social or professional context. The modesty traditions of Islam and some branches of Christianity are in part about liberating women from that constant judgement. It is notable that several Muslim nations had female heads of state or government before Australia did.

#CFTD #2021_10_09

Thanks to Cherie for a beaut game yesterday, and well done to Neha for the actual winning the ball before passing it to me, and Sam for handballing back to me after I'd tried to move it on quickly to him. (In the parlance of local footy commentary, when the ball is directed toward a group of unopposed team mates, "they could raffle it".)  It's seems the roulette ball has dropped onto my number once gravity claimed its inevitable triumph. Today let's clue for ways of selecting a random winner - drawing lots, roll of the dice, toss of a coin, etc. Interesting regional customs if you have some to share...

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Here are the 10+ scores, which came from eight different setters. Great to see! And despite a late dash from Simon's clever surface, the nice punny clue from Sam at the start of the game held on for victory...

17 + 14 - Sam Zipcat - Determining how Da Vinci became so skilled? (7,4)
13 + 14 - Simon T. Hill - Sailor’s death at sea is questioned by arbitrator (5,2,5)

10 + 8 - Juhi Saklani - He cited time-honoured gambling procedure (4, 2, 3, 4)
9 + 7 - Joel Hess - My enemy - one enemy - I defeated for a way to choose a winner (4, 5, 4, 3)
12 + 4 -Nat Rengasamy - Many attempt to get first entry in the game of chance (7)
10 + 6 - Heidi Schroeder - Re-styling plain coif is one way to turn heads! (4,1,4)

8 + 2 - Bec Crannaford - Zip into rodeo, running wild with a right to get something for just turning up (4,5)
8 + 2 - Roy Leban - Strange icon - it shows a head half the time (4)

Well done to everyone, and I shall pass the baton (sorry about the endlessly mixed sporting metaphors) to Sam, who may at his discretion wish to run with it or pass it on again. (Sometimes it feels like we could have a side game laying bets on who will host the next CFTD...)

#CFTD #2021_09_27

Happy timing allowed a fairly straightforward clue of mine to take the last game, but just near the end I thought of one I was happier with, for TRUFFULA, the vital tree of Dr Suess's masterpiece The Lorax. After an enthusiastic discussion on the topic of that author, it seemed to me a pretty fair idea for our next theme. So please clue for anything related to the LIFE AND WORK OF THEODOR SEUSS GEISEL (DR. SEUSS). Biographical details, famous stories, his invented creatures and words. As ever, if you are cluing for an obscure title, name or made-up word please try to use a form of word play that gives the solver a fighting chance of arriving at the correct answer even if they don't know it or are unsure of the spelling. This will be especially important for the good doctor's sillier inventions!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

WILD GEESE 
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.

#CFTD #2021_08_17

Today let's celebrate COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CULTURES ... especially anything to do with overcoming language barriers, e.g. PHRASE BOOOK / GOOGLE TRANSLATE / ESPERANTO / LINGUA FRANCA / BABEL FISH / GESTICULATION / BODY LANGUAGE. Clue for any such thing, or make clues whose surface is all about the theme (i.e. not just which happen to contain a key word).

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. And it was also good to see plenty of voting - I usually list entries scoring 10 points and above in the results - I settled for 12+ this time but it's still quite a big roll call...

15 + 12 - Juhi Saklani - Snuggle again, passionately! Use your hands to communicate! ( 4, ￼8 )

15 + 4 - Saurabh Upadhyay - Try and stare or get a translator (6)
13 + 6 - Raj Jayaram - Brave method of communication like mass-song remix (5,7)

13 + 4 - Simon T. Hill - Baffled as naked husbands join a digital meeting (9)

6 + 10 - Alec Macaulay - Light up and cycle a long way (5)
12 + 4 - Oisin Clarke-Willis - Rotates translation stone (7)
12 + 4 - Raj Jayaram - Hopes are built around primarily marine form of communication (9)
14 + 2 - Heidi Schroeder - A visual representation of a musical instrument's sound (6)

9 + 6 - Binay Patra - Highly prose style of ancient writing system (11)
11 + 4 - Sam Zipcat - Unscrambles mixed signal (6)

10 + 4 - Heidi Schroeder - Bachelor appearing in lustiest new film feature (9)
10 + 4 - Raj Jayaram - Kind of code integral to algorithm or sequence (5)

8 + 4 - Melissa McSeismal - Sixth sense exposed desperate tirade mid-story in language meant to be unifying {9}
6 + 6 - Monty Green - Perhaps Ruth starts listening to chum, possibly with in-ear translator? (5,4)

Great to see so many people contributing, bringing their many different flavours of clue to the game for our enjoyment. At least one new name to me in there - welcome Oisin and nice work today. Today's winner, with sound amrous advice is Juhi... who could argue with the value of a nice passionate snuggle complete with manual communication? Congratulations and over to you Juhi!

It's an alphabetic jigsaw style crossword, this week with an extra twist: each clue ignores the first letter of the answer in the word play. (e.g. "A time for pet (3)" might clue for "CAT")

From this week's new puzzle at Ben's Cryptics, "A Brownlow Champion":
https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/puzzle654a.html
It's an alphabetic jigsaw style crossword, but it can still be done online (awkwardly) and there's a link to a "normal" version as well. (Refer to both together for the easiest version!) BUT this week there's another catch: in both versions, each clue ignores the first letter of the answer in the word play. (e.g. "A time for pet (3)" might clue for "CAT") That adds little difficulty in the jigsaw version where the clues are indexed by first letter so you always know what it is anyway. But for the non-jigsaw version, which uses the same clues, it might make things quite tricky, and you may have to use a bit of reasoning by elimination to get through.

#CFTD #2021_07_27 Oh Lordy the RINGs!
The Olympics are providing a feast of inconsequential distraction, and although they have already provided at least one CFTD theme, I think we can afford to wring one more out of them! Today...
(i) clue for the word RING or any synonym of it in any sense (including derived forms e.g. RANG, CIRCLES)
(ii) clue for any word or phrase containing RING, e.g. "meringues" or "infringes"
(iii) use at least TWO occurrences of the letter sequence RING in your clue
Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3
Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#example of (iii)
Leaders of poor in general have fringes of gay muppet diva? (5)

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Once again, a nice spread of scores with five different setters in the top five, bringing us a diversity of clue styles to enjoy.

6 + 7 - Steve Allen - First day, and ordering about? Nerve! (7-2)
5 + 6 - Victor Rupert Williamson - Support for those in retirement? (10)
5 + 4 - Monty Green - Aura revealed by encephalography (4)
5 + 4 - Anita Pai Raiturker - Copy late caller (4, 6)

Well done all, and over to Simon!

#CFTD #2021_07_25 TRIPLE TROUBLE
Yes "triple" letters are the essence of today's game. Please clue for any word that satisfies this condition: the first letter is the same as the last letter, AND the same as the middle letter (or both middle letters for an even-length word). This is one of the tautest conditions I've set, offering one of the rarer subsets of the English lexicon to be dredged up, which I won't enumerate here, BUT this text contains numerous "suggestions"!

#CFTD #2021_07_22 #FIBONACCI
Congratulations to yesterday's winner Juhi and thank you for entrusting me with the responsibility of launching today's game. And well done to Alec for a stimulating game, as well as a nice tribute to a classic tortured artist. Today's theme may require a little bit more research on your part, since I won't be giving you the word list on a plate this time (or even in a saucerful of secrets). Today's theme is FIBONACCI - the name, the mathematician, the number sequence, and all things related to the above, particularly mathematically. Those already in the know will realise RABBIT population growth may be involved, as well as a GOLDEN RATIO, but there is so much more when you go looking...

#RESULTS 

This topic proved quite challenging. I must admit, although the mathematical topic itself is rich in connections and associations, related vocabulary (accessible to a broader audience) didn't seem all that plentiful as I found when I tried to come up with a few more words to offer when answering Sam's comment.

Of course, what I could have done to encourage participation, is use a chain-tagging scheme: Each player "in the game" posts a clue every hour, and from their second clue onwards, they also tag a new player into the game each time. Then, starting with just one player, we would have had hourly clue tallies of 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... :)

Here are the podium clues...

12 + 12 - SSv Avtaar - Queen’s unhappy with Church order ( 8 )
6 + 6 - Melissa McSeismal - Manuscript of famous pianist in recital about sailor {5, 5}
7 + 4 - Nat Rengasamy - Cocaine and opium, for example, are what the series is based upon (7, 7)

Congratulations to SSv running away with the votes for a clue with a nice and neat, perfectly plausible surface. Over to you!

#CFTD #2021_07_19

We are counting down to the 2020 Olympics (having just completed Euro 2020... I think you could be forgiven for being a bit confused and putting the wrong date on forms this year), possibly destined to be the first olympics in living memory which WON'T be declared "the best olympic games ever". (I say "possibly" because some hyperbolic traditions are hard to relinquish. But hopefully they'll get a bit creative and select some other appropriate superlative to apply this time around.) Today please clue for CURRENT OLYMPIC EVENTS (i.e. events that are included in this Olympiad). Beware becase they do the ring the changes! There are some new ones in, but others have gone by the wayside.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS - It looks like things have gone very quiet for the last several hours ... perhaps a new working week intervened! The reactions were correspondingly a bit thin for most of the later clues, but we had some lovely entries. I particularly liked Heidi's clue highlighting the quest in equestrian, which came close to winning thanks to plenty of 3-point rewards. But today's winner is Sam Zipcat with his tasty olympic kebab stall...

12 + 4 - Sam Zipcat - Kebab stall catered for Olympic sport (10)
8 + 7 - Heidi Schroeder - Olympic event nearly rained out. Holding pursuit inside (10)
8 + 6 - Roy Leban - Outside of Korea, martial art became, ultimately, an olympic sport (6)
9 + 2 - ￼Simon T. Hill - Girls went crazy for sport (9)
9 + 2 - Monty Green - Wanked too vigorously for martial art! (9)
￼
...thanks everyone, and over to you Sam!

#CFTD #2021_06_28 - LOCAL ICONS

Let's see some provincial pride, and neighbourly name-dropping! Today please clue for famous people or things that have their origins in - OR are widely associated with - somewhere near you. I'm being deliberately vague rather than specifying "your country" or "your town" ... cast the net as wide as you need to in order to find an interesting subject! As usual, the more obscure your answer (especially if it is a name, with the potential spelling anomalies that come with names) the more you should try to use a form of word play that gives the solver a fighting chance of arriving at the correct spelling even if they don't know it.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2021_06_26 - NAMES with ALLITERATION

Thanks to Victor for an interesting game with the 6-word limit really making us tighten up our surfaces. (I discovered last summer that falling asleep at the beach can also result in tightening up of ones surfaces - I swear the leg I left in full sun ended up with crackling on it. But I digress...) Today's theme will possibly see us straying in the other direction, but I would still encourage people to keep their clues nice and compact if they can.

Today, clue for ALLITERATIVE NAMES (of real life people or things, or ones taken from well known fiction). So, any names where both parts start with the same sound, even if it's not the same letter. (e.g. Clark Kent). (Conversely, same letter is no good if the sound is nt the same - e.g. don't clue for "Saint Sharon" even though both parts start with 's'.) You can go for names with more than two parts as long as they ALL start with the same sound, e.g. Ku Klux Klan.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!



#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Lots of later clues seemed to largely miss out on the reactions, but as we know that's how it goes. Heidi has demonstrated that the power of getting in early is amplified considerably by getting in early with a really good clue!.

Since the one that got me home took us north from Quebec into the Arctic Circle, let's clue for words or phrases to do with that far northern reach of our globe... countries, territories or seas that lie (at least partly) inside the circle, culture, geography, wildlife, natural phenomena associated with the region, etc. Idioms involving these things are also welcome.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

Not having found time to appreciate more than a small portion of the many clues submitted, I will simply pass on the verdict of the voting public. Here are the top results, with LOTS of folks grabbing a share of equal fifth on nine points.

7 + 8 - Heidi Schroeder - Cold, plain fish stuffed with a little dill and rice (6)

5 + 6 - Heidi Schroeder - When covered with a little snow, a large part of Europe becomes a mighty cold place! (7)

6 + 4 - Monty Green - Bend and twitch — it’s freezing! (6)

BEES - clue for words or phrases to do wth bees

One of the under-reported big issues of our time is the crisis in apiculture globally. (It's not just about honey!) One of those things that flies under the radar, as the mundane business of food production seems to be of little interest to the western media. Clearly people are more worried about royal babies and celebrity boxing matches than about feeding humanity. So let's all read up about bees and share some new vocabulary and knowledge with one another. (For instance, I just learnt that "apiary" does NOT mean bee-keeping.)
https://e360.yale.edu/features/declining_bee_populations_pose_a_threat_to_global_agriculture
Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3
Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

11 + 12 - Jeremy Bate - Ask one country what bees can do! (11)
9 + 10 - Debbie Manber Kupfer - Male doctor, single (5)
7 + 8 - Alec Macaulay - Queen’s breakfast served up jolly early (5,5)
7 + 4 - Monty Green - Honey Hoffman - UK artist in hiding! (6)
6 + 4 - Monty Green - He-Man poetry about insects (11)

Thanks for everyone's participation. Sorry for the slight delay in results. There was a concerned raised with me about whether the winning clue was effectively a rerun, which has been a topic of discussion recently. I have looked at some previous clues for the same word on CCS that have used a similar word play, but to my mind the definitions and surfaces were quite different. Indeed, none I saw had used "ask" for "poll" which I think gives Jeremy's clue much of its character, hinting at echoes of JFK "ask what you can do for your country". So I have no problem with awarding the game the way the votes fell, and handing the baton to Jeremy.

PM to Jeremy:
Hi Jeremy. Firstly well done on winning the Clue-For-The-Day contest at CCS yesterday. I'm sorry if the experience was marred either by Chris bickering about the correctness of the clue (and I didn't think his objection made sense really) or by the suggestion that was put to me (and which I reported but dismissed in announcing the results) that the clue was recycled.

Anyway, the convention is that the winner of the day's game gets to host the next game, so although there's been a bit of a delay, you're still welcome to take that on.

But if you don't want to, please let us know and we can keep the ball rolling with someone else posting a game. (If we haven't heard from you soon we'll go ahead and do that anyway.)

#CFTD #2021_06_15
BOTHER! Today please clue for words or phrases about things being bothersome, ranging from people or things which peeve (miscreant, pest, brat, parasite, etc.) to things going wrong (problem, issue, glitch, hiccup, fly in the ointment, bug, spanner in the works, SNAFU, etc.) Please stick to words which have (at least potentially) this general meaning, as opposed to specific things which you categorise thus. (For instance, don't clue for "protestor" ... even though you may consider a protestor to be bothersome, the word has not taken on that general meaning. Likewise, "power outage", "child", "red tape" may all at times be frustrating things but are too specific for today's game.)

Today's theme is CHOCOLATE. Clue for something to do with chocolate, or use a reference to such in your surface. PLEASE make sure that you have read / solved / judged some other clues before jumping in (unless you're first in of course). If you've come late to the game and there are already hundreds of clues, at least go through and read some of them - perhaps go through the more recent ones (to help later entries) and scan the earlier ones for those scoring well and add likes to your favourites.

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS

Thanks for everyone's participation. I must apologise for being a something of an absentee host, as I am doing some granddad-childcare currently. Some of the clues I did have time to read were quite pleasing in various ways. Like chocolate! Here are the top three, with a strong 1-3 finish for Heidi, to whom I now happily pass the baton.

Thorns are my language.
I announce my existence
with a bleeding touch.
Once these thorns were flowers.
I loathe lovers who betray.
Poets have abandoned the deserts
to go back to the gardens.
Only camels remain here, and merchants,
who trample my blooms to dust.
One thorn for each rare drop of water.
I don’t tempt butterflies,
no bird sings my praise.
I don’t yield to droughts.
I create another beauty
beyond the moonlight,
this side of dreams,
a sharp, piercing,
parallel language.

#CFTD #2021_05_09 #PUZZLES
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle
As seems to be popular these days, I will pivot via the previous winning clue, which was for SUDOKU, to a new theme, which will be PUZZLES. Please clue for any types of puzzle... which could vary from the general ("RIDDLE") to the specific ("SEVEN BRIDGES OF KONIGSBERG"). For famous puzzles which end in the word "puzzle", I think it would be best to omit that word and clue for the rest of the name, e.g. "EIGHT QUEENS". For obscure and/or proprietary names (e.g. names specific to a publication, like "QUIPTIC") please make sure that your word play gives a fair chance of solving even for those unfamiliar. NOTE that I've tweaked the scoring to make a laugh worth 1 point. Sometimes a clue gives me a chuckle, without being a good clue for other reasons - I like the idea of a reaction that gives a point for the humour to such a clue. If it's funny AND good and so you think it warrants two points, give it a 'care' (or 'wow' for three).

Scoring: laugh/like = 1  love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2021_04_22
Today's theme is ELEPHANTS.
Either answer or clue surface (or both) should relate to the theme in some way. As usual I will not weigh in to declare whether or not clues are sufficiently relevant ... I leave that as part of the audience's judgement.
Scoring: like/laugh = 1 love/cry/care = 2, wow = 3
Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#NFC

#RESULTS

We had lots of ewual runners-up on 10 points, and Melissa way out in front on 24.

17 + 7 - Melissa McSeismal - Large animals with scruffy, ashen pelt ( 9 )

5 + 5 - Jay Greenwich - Beginners recall studying keyboard, some unhappily tinkling the ivories (5)
7 + 3 - Simon T. Hill - Miles for one elephant? (9)
