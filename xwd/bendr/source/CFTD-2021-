#CFTD #2024_09_02 #SEASONING

Thanks Melissa for hosting when I was slack yesterday, and for a novel theme which I thought was a rich vein for the mining.
Seasons. Aside from you people in the northern hemisphere, while mysteriously clinging to the underside of the globe, having your seasons back to front, I note that there are varying conventions about when they start anyway. In some places, the equinoxes and solstices mark the change (spring officially starts at spring equinox). Here in Australia we go from the start of the calendar month containing that astronomical marker. So today is the second day of spring. Yay! So...
...please clue for anything to do with SPRING - the season or any other meaning, or, 'cos of the hemisphere thing, for associations with AUTUMN or FALL (any meanings), or, 'cos of the different start dates, SUMMER or WINTER, or, now that we've got them all anyway, anything to do with SEASONS (any meaning - so yes your favourite spices count, as does Vivaldi). Now that I've permitted a goodly chunk of the dictionary, let's go!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. A nice diverse selection of clues, with the 10+ scores coming from six different setters...

5 + 6 - Catriona Malone￼ - Spice girl stalked by number one admirer & extremely nauseating gangster (￼ 8 )
7 + 4 - Tony Morris - Intrinsically intense: as on sensing flavours (7)

4 + 6 - Roger Cushing - Time of year you in Paris separate gold from manganese (6)
(nfc but 10) - Juhi Saklani - Humpty Dumpty had a wonderful autumn... (5, 4)

Out in front by a healthy margin is Juhi's clue evoking a lovable but lonely bear... over to you!

#CFTD #2024_08_30 #BUILDING

Thanks Jennie for taking us shopping yesterday. Not that I am a big fan of shopping, but it's always good to have ones horizons expanded by being dragged into an unfamiliar field. OK, I admit it, I already knew what a 'supermarket' was before composing the clue, but the shopping experience beyond that is a bit of a foreign world to me. Another realm of life that can be a bit foreign to many of us, at least if we have grown up embracing more cerebral pursuits (and hence landing on this activity), is the practical world of HOUSE BUILDING. Furthermore, being an old activity, it is rich with interesting little words for us, from studs and noggins to cornices and ridge caps. So that's our theme for today...

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 
Thanks for everyone's participation. A bit of a quiet game, but once again lots of strong voting, so great to see that people are taking the time to appreciate and acknowledge each others' clues. Here are all the 10+ scores...

8 + 10 - Roger Cushing - Aeroflot’s flying around over the house! (5,4)
10 + 6 - Simon T. Hill - Court date for Firestarter (4)
8 + 8 - Jennie Willson - Part of stud wall is made up of bare old parts (12)
9 + 6 - Arvind Nangia - Polite structural design professional? (5,8)
8 + 4 - Patricia Sawyer - Wow! Lovely! Right at the top in fact (7)
6 + 7 - David Basden - First trumpet enters playing a semitone flat (10)
9 + 2 - Jennie Willson - Conservative European people have time to bond (6)
11 - Joel Hess - Repair of wood automobile enclosure? Give it a shot (9)
6 + 4 - David Basden - Dubiously chained before a homestead? [8]
8 + 2 - Manbir Khurana - Drunk English on roof! (7)
6 + 4 - Simon T. Hill - Builder and master engineer (9)

Topping the lot (as roofing materials are wont to do) is Roger's clue for roof slate, so it'll be over to him for the next game.

#CFTD #2024_08_27 #GEMSTONES
Thank you Sabitha Satchi for the Monday game. Whenever I went to think of Monday expressions to clue for I had the Rolling Stones song "Ruby Tuesday" come into my mind instead. I think it would be a bit too obvious to go to 'Tuesday' for today's theme (and in any case Victor already explored some other days of the week in his clues). So instead I'll run with the 'ruby' connection... today please clue for any gemstones. Or related words, e.g. lapidary, facet, etc.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. And for the very enthusiastic voting. Everyone must have been in a good mood! I usually list all the clues scoring over ten, which in this case is about half of the clue submitted. But there were a lot of really good clues, so I don't think we need assume that there has been an outbreak of pathological euphoria. Anyhow, topping the chart with a massive score of 33 is Heidi's alternative (or at least alternating) clue for the dear stone that inspired the day's play.

13 + 20 - Heidi Schroeder - One of the costliest gemstones? Staggering, arguably! (4)
11 + 15 - Saurabh Upadhyay - Dad, I am on duty protecting the Kohinoor for one! (7)
12 + 11 - Benjamin James - Fruit with large stone (5)
9 + 12 - Jennie Willson - Stone atop unknown cross (4)
9 + 10 - Steve Allen - Our quest? One Rolling Stone (9)
8 + 10 - Heidi Schroeder - Stay stoned, having indulged in speed and hard rock? [8]
7 + 8 - Shailesh Tipnis - Scheme to strip layers and reveal jewel! (3)
9 + 6 - Benjamin James - Chambermaid tucks away gemstone (5)
6 + 8 - David Basden - Rock your old street after first adjusting mum’s earplugs [8]
9 + 5 - Steve Allen - Chernobyl disaster: no church left, some rock revealed (5)
9 + 4 - Manbir Khurana - Bewildered gnomes set jewels (9)
8 + 4 - Roger Cushing - Polite hero fashioned a gemstone (10)
10 + 2 - Roger Cushing - Polish unknown gemstone (4)
9 + 2 - Simon T. Hill - Bury fake wedding anniversary gift (4)
5 + 6 - Catriona Malone - Green mineral tea? Hic! (9)
7 + 4 - Catriona Malone - Girls, best friends say, Jennie Willson, Mackenzie Sorensen and Patricia Sawyer touring Lalibela, Austria and the capital of Nebraska? (10)
7 + 4 - Steve Allen - Rock, e.g. most of monster jewel (8 )

Well done all, and over to you Heidi!

#CFTD #2024_08_10 #CONCRETE
Thank you Manbir Khurana for yesterday's motivational game. I got so pepped up that today I'm out concreting. Although I suspect I forgot that cost-benefit analysis step, or at the very least ignored the opinions of various aging body parts in that process.
Today please clue for, or with, anything to do with the word "concrete" in any sense. History or production process or uses etc. of the actual stuff, or synonyms of the word. By "or with" I mean you are welcome to use some such word or phrase in your surface instead of as your answer.
Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3
Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2024_08_07 #DEPUTIES

Thanks to Sam for the mathematical game, and well done to the actual winner. As the second-place getter stepping up to the hosting job, I am reminded of the fact that history sometimes puts a 'running mate' into the top job. I've just read that Tim Walz has been chosen to 'balance' the Kamala Harris presidential ticket. Of course Kamala has risen from VP to unexpectedly find herself possibly on track for the presidency (having replaced Biden who was also a previous VP). And one of the real 'sliding doors' moments of US history came at the 1944 Democratic convention. Roosevelt's chosen VP and protoge Henry Wallace - a very progressive voice who aspired to heading off the cold war and cooperating with the USSR, got rolled in some dodgy shenanigans which saw Truman take the VP spot, and go on to be a hawkish cold war president. (Some have suggested that his decision to use atom bombs in WW2 was partly motivated by a desire to show off the capability - and willingness to use it - to the soviets.) Another relevant bit of history springs to mind that I will be vague about, as it forms the theme of my puzle today!

Today please clue for anything about deputy- or vice- positions (including words from beyond the political sphere, such as 'reserve' and 'understudy'), in particular any of the more famous examples of vices who have gone on to step up into the main role. Alternatively, make clues about Tim Walz or features of his CV (there are plenty of summaries available in the news today).

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks everyone for stepping up to the challenge. I wonder how Kamala made her decision. If I have to choose a vice I find it difficult because I have so many vices that I enjoy. :) Luckily choosing a winner from today's contest is easier... Alec's divine sceptre clue shot out to an early lead and was never overtaken. Although in the spirit of the game I should congratulate Sabitha Satchi on sitting in second spot, ready to take over if Alec is unavailable...

14 + 16 - Alec Macaulay - Divine sceptre comes to second in command (4, 9)
10 + 8 - Sabitha Satchi - Assistant’s responsibility includes exercise standing on head (6)
7 + 8 - Catriona Malone - Dr Lina, second to inspire Michael Jackson's footwork? (4, 6)
9 + 6 - Roger Cushing - Assistant obtains rude bananas (11)

Well done everyone and over to you Alec (or your runner up...)

#CFTD #2024_08_05 #WORKING_TOGETHER

I've just been watching some of the scenes of unrest unfolding in the U.K. After the advance of far-right parties in recent European elections, this seems to be part of a current surge in the politics of division and hatred. Accordingly, I was going to make today's theme 'tolerance', but then I realised I've done that exact theme before (albeit a while ago). So instead I'll go for a related concept of COLLABORATION. You can clue for words about co-operation, or for well-known (or deserving to be well-known) instances of cooperation between different groups. This could be between nations (e.g. International Space Station) or races or religions or anything other groupings that sometimes divide us - languages, sporting codes, culinary traditions, academic disciplines, castes, occupations, etc. etc.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2024_08_03 #MIDDLING

Thank you Steve for a game where we thought about the apogees and nadirs of human endeavour. Today let's focus on somewhere in between - the average, run-of-the-mill, par-for-the-course, middling, unexceptional, typical, etc. I expect this game to be neither sensational nor awful, just so-so!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS

Thanks for everyone's participation. And a lot of participation - and voting - there was! Not the lacklustre unexceptional game I called for at all. Tsk Tsk. But I will forgive your collective excellence, just this once. Here are the (many) 10+ scores...

10 + 14 - Roger Cushing - The Reverend’s conundrum about the way of doing things is unexceptional (6,2,3,4)
10 + 10 - Simon T. Hill - Bad actors need work (6,4)
7 + 4 - Manbir Khurana - Dad’s coat is fine (￼ 8 )
8 + 8 - Shailesh Tipnis - Blend dry, vegetarian vanilla (6,7)
6 + 6 - Manbir Khurana - Silly use the iron repeatedly! (7,4,3,5)
5 + 6 - Tulika Das - A new holiday home abroad is nothing special (7)
8 + 3 - Jennie Willson - Nun made dancing dull (7)
6 + 4 - David Basden - Rather in disarray, West Ham scores zilch ( 8 )
6 + 4 - Jennie Willson - Agitated me loads - and again! Boring! (4,3,4,3)

Sticking his head furtherest above the parapet was Roger with his nice natural Spoonerism of 'riddle of the mode'. So as punishment for this tall poppy and his failure to stay in the middle of the herd, he can lead us into the next instalment...

#CFTD #2024_05_30 #PLAYGROUND_EQUIPMENT

Thank you Roger Cushing for the monkey game, it was prime, mate! I had an unsolved clue in that contest, although not a very good one, being my struggling attempt at my weekly clue-cum-advertisement promoting my latest puzzle. (https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/puzzle800.html) That clue was for "monkey bars", which prompts today's theme... playground equipment. I expect this will bring some head-scratchers, given that the names of various pieces of equipment (and indeed what exists) has been quite variable between places and times. Hopefully everyone has heard of a SLIDE and SWINGS, but variants like TEETER-TOTTER might be new to some. So please clue for any of the things we put in parks (and back yards) for the physical diversion of our young. I want you all to have fun, play nicely, and as my dad would say "if you fall off that jungle gym and break both of your legs don't come running to me!"

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

#CFTD #2024_05_06 #FITNESS

I'm scrambling to get a game posted in time to go for an evening fitness run. So today let's clue for fitness and (closely) related topics, e.g. not sports in general but sports and events with an emphasis on endurance (marathon, channel swimming, mountaineering, etc.), activities around measures around fitness (jogging, circuit, cross-training, beep test, resting heart rate). This is a 24 hour event, so pace yourselves!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

“Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. 
Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. 
With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.”

#CFTD #2024_04_25 #CONSONANTAL_DRIFT






Keeping with the topic of the last game I hosted - the challenges of an unbalanced Scrabble hand... this time let us consider the reverse scenario - too many consonants!
Today please clue for consonant-heavy words. Specifically, the word or expression you clue for should have at least FOUR more consonants than vowels. Again 'Y' is considered a consonant, which will be helpful today!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1,  cry/care = 2,  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. There was plenty to like among this batch of clues. Heidi was sitting comfortably in first and second place for most of the duration, but Antonio came late with another one of his lovely smooth constructions, giving a very plausible musical surface, and snagging just enough votes to pinch it at the death (with the help of my usual tie-splitting rule of favouring the later clue). Well done to Peter for also getting two clues up amongst the top scorers,

9 + 10 - Antonio Sarmiento - Queen covered Yesterday’s intro on new song (4)
11 + 8 - Heidi Schroeder - Young girls in New York taking speed? A little scary! (6)
11 + 5 - Heidi Schroeder - Subtle dexterity of the tongue? (6)
9 + 6 - Peter Olander - Collection accepts Rands for the late morning service (6)
10 + 4 - Peter Olander - Quick reminder (6)
6 + 4 - Dave Bromage - When the sky is moonless, we hear Batman (4, 6)
10 - David Basden - Had us try hash today in Sydney [8]

Well done everyone and over to you Antonio!

#CFTD #2024_04_22 #VOWEL_MOVEMENT

Those of you who play Scrabble regularly will be familiar with the feeling of a woefully unbalanced hand... as you stare forlornly at a rack with the tile I I I E E O R, you despairingly proclaim "oh for some vowel movement", at which point your hard-of hearing aunt offers you some tablets she has that help with that sort of thing...
Today please clue for vowel-heavy words. Specifically, the word or expression you clue for should have at least two more vowels than consonants. And 'Y' is not being granted vowel status for this purpose!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

Thanks for lots of nice clues, and the odd interesting new word.

Antonio came in first and second today, showing how well a good smooth surface will turn those thumbs into hearts

6 + 8 - Sam Raj - Cake portal with gold! (6)
9 + 4 - Frieda Jerosa Lewis - Coati and lion, unusual alliance (9)

#CFTD #2024_04_13 #CONSPIRACY_THEORIES

I have been somewhat unwell for the last couple of days (on the mend now), the result of which is spending too much apathetic time sitting in front of the computer, wasting time engaging with idiotic posts on social media that I should be just ignoring. And a lot of those idiotic posts are about conspiracy theories. (I also watched an entertaining and informative video about "sovereign citizens" which I will link below.) Today clue for anything to do with conspiracy theories. You could go for things that are famous for attracting bizarre theories - the moon landing (as shot by Stanley Kubrik on the 2001 set), JFK (as shot by a mystery second shooter), COVID, climate change (as concocted by a global cabal of corrupt scientists, which just happens to be nearly all of them), vaccines, aliens, etc. etc.. Or you could go for related terminology such as "rabbit hole" or "tin foil hat". Alternatively, you may have a surface referring to or describing a conspiracy theory, instead of the answer.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 
Thank you all for a fabulous bunch of clues. I notice some are still unanswered, but I assume that's due to some sort of deep state plot. Along with acknowledging all the fine clues, I'd like to grant the quip-of-the-day award to Dave Bromage's observation "All of these great anagram finds re conspiracy theories... it can't be a coincidence, surely!" I'd also like to give a big call out to the various intelligence officers around the world who have no doubt stumbled on our game as their AI web crawlers report a hot spot of conspiratorial keywords. I hope you enjoyed the game as much as we did! Now for the top scores. Voting was as healthy as participation, so my usual habit of listing scores of 10+ put a lot of clues onto the leader board...

14 + 19 - Antonio Sarmiento - Contaminated chemical agent caused global warming, perhaps (7, 6)
14 + 12 - Manbir Khurana - Failed recount, dubious political controversy (8,5)
9 + 11 - Dave Bromage - The King lives... perhaps (5)
9 + 8 - Steve Allen - Reverend said: "Expensive evening out for the elite" (4,5)
9 + 8 - Shailesh Tipnis - Free cello handout is a conspiracy! (9,6)
10 + 6 - Patricia Sawyer - Ah let fart out! It makes us level. (4,5)
7 + 4 - Steve Allen - Craic? Phoney story? Ridiculously phoney story! (10,6)
7 + 4 - Mark Wainwright - Confused Mr Mojo risin' - I'm not dead ? (3,8)
5 + 5 - Sam Raj - Adapt fast we hear, for supposed crooner turned spy! (6,5)

All in all, a splendid effort by many participants. And I am delighted to invite the living soul who answers to the name of Antonio Sarmiento to host the next game ... if he really exists ...

#CFTD #2024_04_10 #VOLUNTEERING

As the last game was being wrapped up, I was in the midst of chopping several kilos of onions at a community cafe where I volunteer. (Lest you think I'm a selfless community hero, I am actually fairly transactional about it... in exchange for a few hours food prep on Wednesday and playing some piano to the other diners on a Thursday evening, I do enjoy a good meal and often take home lots of miscellaneous produce.) For today's theme, let's clue for expressions to do with volunteer work. This could be one of the many organisations that people volunteer with, vocabulary to do with volunteering, related moral concepts, etc. Indeed, to keep the options broad we could extend to charitable deeds and charity more broadly. Of course I can't be too demanding, because I'm not paying any of you to do this. It's purely voluntary!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. There were some lovely clues. (And by the way, I have answered my own first clue at the top of the thread.) It must be the season for acknowledging one another's lives beyond CCS. I got here with a clue about Steve's drumming, and now Rhiannon has won the day convincingly with a clue referencing my volunteer onion chopping. What a pleasant trend! Here are the top four scores...

11 + 13 - Rhiannon Vivian-Bolt - Onion (tad roughly) chopped as a gift ( 8 )
8 + 8 - Sam Raj - Trust: It's checked by cleaner yardsticks, initially (7)
8 + 8 - Mark Wainwright - Start of Subsidy I hear, for charity ? (￼ 8 )
9 + 2 - Melissa McSeismal - Burn with sex appeal! Why oral is a gift! {7}

#CFTD #2024_03_30 #AUTO_MECHANIC

I have been trying to learn some practical life skills lately... one of those good intentions that's always lurking in the background and occasionally prompts some actual action. In particular I've been trying to learn a bit more about making my automobile function appropriately (or at all just at the moment). And I am reminded that each time we dip into an unfamiliar field of expertise, we find an exciting new trove of vocabulary. Today, let's clue for words related to the workings of motor vehicles. Note the topic is NOT cars generally - we don't want makes and models, or words about driving, roads, traffic, accidents, registration etc. We are focussed on the mechanical side of things. Alternators, spark plugs, fuel pumps, fanbelts, cams, timing belts, injection, welsh plugs, sumps, etc. etc. Let's not be scared to stretch our own and each other's knowledge. I'm hoping that 24 hours from now, after I look up and read about all the weird and wonderful concepts you introduce me too, I will have learnt so much that I then realise what I'm doing wrong and then manage to get my car running again by the end of the weekend! Or on a less ambitious note, if we have some fun and maybe someone learns something, it's all worth while...

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS
Good morning (down under time) ... and thanks for everyone's participation. Lots of interesting bits and pieces for me to learn about. No wonder I can't get these damn things to work, there's so many bits! I will keep this brief, as given the time zone our winner may be on the cusp of retiring for the night... Steve took it away with his neat DD for "clutch". For our American friends, that's an extra pedal some of us have in our car that helps with changing gears. ;) Take it away Steve, and no stalling please!

#CFTD #2024_03_20 #TOO_FAR
Thank you to Roger for a game of fun filled with furry friends, but hopefully not flowing with fiery feminist fury for my successful but questionable clue. I do apologise if it did offend anyone, and I would hate to be responsible for making this (or any other) forum into a boy's club where women don't feel comfortable. Which brings me to todays theme....  anything suggested by the phrase "GOING TOO FAR"
From vaguely synonymous phrases like "foot-in-mouth" and "faux pas" to words like overexertion, overreaction, ... (come to think of it, most compound words beginning with "over"!) to people or things that the phrase suggests to you. It could be Pheidippides for going that extra mile delivering news of the battle of Marathon. It could be Jim Carrey for his acting style, or Donald Trump for ... well for everything really.

#CFTD #2024_03_12 #LOBBY_GROUPS #THINK_TANKS

I don't really like jumping in ahead of someone, but that war Roger's instructions, so I will compromise by trying to imagine what sort of game Tony would set if he was first in. I had a look at the last few themes he ran, to see if there was a direction suggested:
two clues in one sentence ... punctuation ... three words ... championship ... Wales ... in ...
which go me nowhere. But I did notice that Tony, like a lot of people, likes to make the next theme something to do with the previous one, or his winning clue. Tony's clue was for "primrose", which seem to be the emblem of a UK Conservative lobby group. On that cheerful note, today lets clue for organisations such as lobby groups and political "think tanks" which attempt to influence the political agenda, discourse and outcomes.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyone's participation. Really! I was a bit worried about this one, because it was hard to thing of targets as these things are so little talked about, operating a little bit in the shadows. Also, a lot of them have really boring names to clue like "Institute of Public Affairs". The first point did make solving difficult, but it was interesting to read about some of the groups working in the space in other parts of the world. I was also happy to see six different people in the top six scores...

10 + 8 - Sam Raj - Conservative thinkers go dressed provocatively according to the Reverend ? (3,5)
10 + 4 - Simon T. Hill - Better welfare for men incarcerated? (6)
9 + 4 - Arvind Nangia - Hah! Moustache-twirling international policy influencers? (7, 5)
7 + 6 - Roger Cushing - Solitary coyotes far off being supporters of social change (5,7,2,4)
5 + 7 - Dave Bromage - Westminster location of heads of thinktanks, unscrupulously formulating rottenest subversion (6, 6)
8 + 4 - Manbir Khurana - Characters drawn from hat, ink draft policy? (5,4)

Excellent work all round! And well done Sam, for your amusing winning clue ... I'm not sure which image was funnier, before or after parsing the Spoonerism. Over to you for the next one!

#CFTD #2024_03_09 #educational_clues

One thing I've always liked about the cryptic format is the opportunity - usually with some educated guesswork - to solve clues for previously unknown words, in the process learning (or getting some idea of) their meaning. For instance, one might solve...
Zest in heart of freelancer (4)
... with some degree of confidence even without being familiar with the answer, and thereby learn the word.
As well as learning new vocabulary, one can also glean bits of history or other areas of knowledge. As in...
He stole vast amounts in sacking of Calcutta ... 154 crore ultimately! (5)
Cargo now includes inert gas (5)

Today please set EDUCATIONAL CLUES, i.e. clues which involve some piece of knowledge which makes the clue work, but (a) someone who doesn't know it might still solve the clue, and (b) in doing so, they learn it.
In the above examples, the 'piece of knowledge' would be...
(i) that elan = zest
(ii) that someone called Clive was involved in a lucrative sacking of Calcutta
(iii) that argon is an inert gas

The proof is in the pudding, and hopefully you will have the satisfaction of people solving the clue and appreciating the little bit of learning... e.g. answering "ELAN ... I never knew what that meant" or "ZUTONS ... I had no idea they wrote that song!"

Also, the proof is in the scoring ... as usual I will leave the judgement of how well a clue fits the brief to the people casting votes.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS

Thanks to everyone who took this on and made today's solving a trip to the classroom for us! There was definitely some knowledge on offer, nicely near the edges of most people's general knowledge (at least among such learned company as this). I did however feel that not all of the clues came to terms with the challenge of making the clue solvable to those ignorant of the key piece of knowledge involved. Long anagrams, for instance, tend to give those solvers little chance. My personal favourite, from Tony Morris, was an examplar of what I had in mind. I didn't know the name "Nabucco", but it seemed plausible as an Italian name, and the word play (without resorting to acrostic or hidden word) was clear enough to have me pretty confident. And it's an excellent surface! Anyway, here are the top vote winners...

7 + 9 - Sam Raj - Encountered a new love with India on vacation for a transformative change of heart ! ( 8 )
5 + 4 - Steve Allen - How do you get to drive badly to a term of mathematics? (7,10)
4 + 4 - Manbir Khurana - Policies Overridden! Adriano is upset with ‘complete’ artist. (8,2,3,5,2,5)
7 + 1 - Arvind Nangia - Lied about moon's crust being suffused with light (6)
special mention - Tony Morris - Ban comeback by University of Cincinnati company for Verdi's opera (7)

Perhaps Tony's clue was a bit late to catch the peak of voting, but in any case Sam Raj's clue - today's runaway winner - was another standout, similarly using a clear charade instruction to put a new word into our vocabulary. So thanks again everyone, and over to you Sam!

#CFTD #2024_02_29 #MARINE_LIFE

Thanks Benjamin James for our extra-terrestrial game. The odd clue in that game related to aliens, which brings us to today's topic. Until we do encounter life from elsewhere in the universe, the most "alien" life we can find tends to be in the oceans, especially at depths that are difficult to visit. Indeed, it has been suggested that octopi provide us with the most alien form of animal intelligence we can interact with, given that they are so far removed from us on the family tree of evolution.
Today please clue for any form of life (animal, vegetable or other) from the oceans.

#CFTD #2024_02_8

Thanks to Neha for yesterday's globetrotting adventure. As I said, it feels odd to win a game with an act of self-promotion, but that's partly because here in Australia we do have a fairly strong cultural taboo against "blowing one's own horn", or as we call it, "being a wanker". I don't think we invented this taboo; I think it is inherited from the British. It may have been amplified and made more overt here by combining with a fairly assertive egalitarianism which once upon a time was a part of Australia's moral identity. In any case, it tends to be identified as a national trait, and under the name "tall poppy syndrome" is often decried as a cultural handicap that deters excellence. (Perhaps many Australians think it's unique to us because the "rest of the world" that they perceive is largely brought to them via commercial TV, and hence consists almost entirely of the U.S.A., where it would seem that quite a different ethic applies.) For today's contest, please clue for words or phrases relating to any of the themes that I've touched on in the above rambling discourse. OR, clue for any word, but with a surface that COHERENTLY says something on the topic. (Not just happens to include a key word.)

As usual when I set a theme, I refuse to adjudicate whether particular expressions fit the theme or not, but instead request that people make that judgement when they are allocating their 'likes' etc., and reward relevance to the theme as one of their scoring criteria.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

Any TV turned on swamps one in self-admiration (6)

￼#nfc #host #rerun

#RESULTS - so, time to single out the tallest poppy so that the rest of us can cut them down to size! Actually, we had three very close at the top of the scoring. Perhaps safety in numbers is the best defence against our overzealous egalitarianism? But, just daring to poke a little higher than the others, and prevailing despite 'laughs' not gaining any extra score under my regime, Chris takes the points with his clue for a novel mixture of pleasure and pain (one imagines).

7 - Chris Lissman - Blowing one's own horn out at La Folie rendition (12)
5 + 1 - Victor Rupert Williamson - Bill loves prohibition (5)
4 + 2 - Roger Cushing - Criticism of success of portly model’s nappy pants (4,5,8)

Special credit also to Steve for plentiful contributions, with a keen focus on the core concepts!

#CFTD #2024_01_08 #Name #Indirect #Telescopic

Thanks to Amy for the previous game of blissful wedlock. And apologies for the little delay as I was chatting about Oscar Peterson after using his name as telescopic fodder in a clue for "carpet". Which brings me to todays challenge. Yes sorry another challenge rather than theme. But todays challenge wont be so intimidating for the setter although it will hopefully offer some enjoyable challenges for solvers! Today I would like to give everyone the license to use a particular novel clue type - the indirect telescopic. The clue I mentioned above was...
Stride foundation provided by Oscar Peterson (6)
But I could have pushed the envelope a bit more with
Runner perhaps in great jazz pianist (6)
which would be a tough and arguably unfair clue. But for todays contest let us consider this indirectness officially fair and indeed required. (And that will make it a bit fairer in practice because as solvers we will be expecting it.)
So for todays contest...
(i) find a name of a real and reasonably well known person which contains a word - ideally broken across parts of their name
	e.g.: LIAR in Julia Roberts
(ii) clue for this word using the persons name as INDIRECT fodder.
	e.g.: Tall story teller in Pretty Woman star (4)
nb: Try to give solvers a chance by not being too vague in either your definition of the target word or your description for the person. Thus great jazz pianist rather than simply musician Pretty Woman star not just actress.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#comment

Hopefully people will be a bit more imaginative with their indicators than I have been in my examples so far! (And as usual I wont hold back from playing along...)

There have been clues offered on the forum from time to time that use a name as direct fodder and I have nothing against those ideas being reused for todays game with clues suitably adapted to fit the rules and guidelines of todays competition. Im pretty sure we had one using Emma Stone recently and of course someones bound to have had their beef with Steve Allen at some point...

Tiny fellow held by scientist exploring electromagnetism (3)
#nfc #host
Old researcher essentially rang a bell? (6)

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyones participation. People seemed have quite a bit of fun with it. And it was nice to see people taking the initiative with variations e.g. reverse telescopics. Here are some of the top scores...

10 + 11 - Sarsa Parilla - Pink Panther actors part is brief (5)
11 + 9 - Heidi Schroeder - Impressionist painter’s bête noire? (5)
7 + 8 - Heidi Schroeder - Christmas retrospective hosted by NBA superstar turned actor/producer (4)
7 + 4 - Benjamin James - Rapper carrying explosive (4)
6 + 4 - Benjamin James - Senegalese football star grips nation (4)
8 + 2 - Antonio Sarmiento - Boy band’s front act provides color (4)
8 + 1 - Steve Allen - Big tenor spouts rubbish (3)

So the victory goes to Sarsas apt remembrance of the disturbed genius that was Peter Sellers. Well done and over to you!

#CFTD #2024_01_05 #SURFACE #MISLEAD

Today Im setting one of those _tough_ structural challenges that I like... There is no theme but you are required to create a clue which not only has a coherent meaningful surface (as we strive to achieve all the time dont we?) but actually has a literal reading that (mis)leads to a pretty definite wrong answer (ignoring the enumeration). For instance...

God of beginnings remover of stoppages topped with head of elephant? (4)

Although its not 4 letters this clue taken literally strongly suggests Ganesha of the Hindu pantheon but the answer is actually EROS.

Extra... In the above example Ive taken the easier option with the actual definition "God" having the same meaning in the literal reading. I would encourage the truly adventurous to try to come up with a clue where the definition is more camouflaged and has a different meaning for the purpose of the surface reading. No bonus score system other than to say when voting please reward people who succeed in this extra challenge.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#nfc #host #example
Former UK PM or chief executive of Greater London Authority? (5)
Land with koala outside and mineral resource in interior (5)
Current leader of Russia (regal type annoying!) (6)
Heavy in symbolism bird rising from ashes sorta blazing? (9)

#RESULTS - it was a very quiet game even by recent CFTD standards. But it was also a very demanding challenge and that is always a bit of a barrier to participation for those without a lot of spare time on their hands! Indeed the game was short enough that it seems unnecessary to summarise it... our winner is Antonio for his MOOD clue... and for his sheer determination in actually managing to field two legitimate entries! Thanks all and over to you Antonio...

Its finally here... this years crowd-sourced Christmas special! Being an alphabetic jigsaw means that half of the fun of solving it still awaits even for those that have seen all the answers to the clues... they still have to be wrestled into the grid consistently.
Thank you to everyone who responded not just to the original game but the Christmas Eve callout for extra clues. In the end there were over 20 contributors which was really pleasing. My policy of making sure that everyone who contributed even one clue was represented in the final puzzle rather forced many editorial decisions. As such there was the odd clue in the final product that wasnt necessarily the best clue submitted for that word or even the best clue from that contributor (there were knock-on effects you see). But overall it came up alright for a bit of holiday fun...

#CFTD #2023_12_02 MIDDLES

Weve had the ends and beginnings so logically with all the respect for the flow of time shown in modern cinema we now must come to the middle! Today EITHER
(i) clue for words related to the concept of middle or centre
(ii) use a word play involving taking the centre of some fodder. This may be the whole of the word play which makes it a form of hidden word clue or it may be for just an element of a larger word play

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS 

It was once again a quiet game and once again I just hope that reflects people having exciting things going on in their real lives away from the screen. Its spring here and the garden is certainly calling to me quite a bit! Our winner with 10 votes is Antonio Sarmiento with "The artichoke’s core (5)" - which caught me out for a moment thinking "hang on that answers nowhere near the centre of the fodder" before the penny dropped that the clue was taking option (i) not (ii). Its got a nice extended definition aspect since heart is a word commonly used for the core of an artichoke. Well done everyone and over to you Antonio.

#CFTD #2023_11_28

Thanks Debbie for yesterdays dictionary diving game - we usually plunge into a dictionary looking for words so raiding it for letters of a word was a nice new twist.

My winning clue was for "crayon" and I had considered posting another clue for the same -

It could be magenta or cyan or mixture (6)

Which gives me the idea for todays game although in fact it is NOT an example of what I am going to ask for! Today please clue for any colour but also follow at least one of the following rules:

(i) use another colour in your clue. For instance:
Shade of pure dun? (3)
(ii) Do not use "colour" (or similar) as the definition:
Socialist leaders of Romania end deliberation (3)

But preferably do both...
Communist terminations of your blue blood (3)

I wont incorporate some baffling bonus system into the scoring - other than to suggest that people vote with a little extra generosity if setters do succeed in satisfying both rules without the clue being rubbish! Now that everyone is thoroughly confused (thats how I roll :) ) let the fun begin!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyones participation. And great to see a lot of voting! I normally list all scores of 10 or more and on quiet days sometimes have to dip a bit lower but today there were half a dozen clues scoring 20+. Here are the top scores...

18 + 18 - Heidi Schroeder - Lives to run! Gets red in the face and a place on the podium! (6)
12 + 14 - Sin Taxman - Browns friend Ivy got real agitated (64)
15 + 6 - Antonio Sarmiento - Sad endings to blurb - farewell adieu goodbye (4)
13 + 8 - Antonio Sarmiento - Citrus tree endemic in Mexicali Mexico (4)
11 + 9 - Cherie Maharam - The old illustrator’s second blue chicken (6)
12 + 8 - Sin Taxman - Aint green could be similar to orange (9)
12 + 6 - Heidi Schroeder - Cause to make a person black and blue and brown? (3)
12 + 4 - Sarsa Parilla - Love a green pitted cocktail of mandarin (6)

I was personally keen on Antonios clues for smooth sensible surfaces whereas the challenge did push most of us into somewhat implausible surfaces. But the voting - by almost any system - overwhelmingly pointed to Heidis early effort. Its surface seemed a little awkward to me but I suppose the sense that can be made of it had resonance with people in our busy competitive age. And it was a nice mixed word play with not-too-obvious indicators so satisfying to solve. Well done and over to you Heidi.

#CFTD #2023_11_21

Today lets clue for FAMOUS _OLD_ VIDEO GAMES ...

(...or we could call them "classic" if "old" gives offence ;) )

From the real dawn-of-the-medium classics like Spacewar! (1962) and the much better known Pong (1972) through to the massive early arcade hits of Space Invaders and Pacman and on to the many well known 80s arcade or home console classics. Best not to go much past the 80s unless its for particularly "important" ones - I guess something like Mario or the even more recent Pokemon could be already deemed to be of historic significance to the medium. Whatever the era of the game as usual keep in mind that a clue for a lesser known title should be crafted in a way to give the solver a fair chance still.
Finally as a pacifist gesture at a time when many of us are a little worn down emotionally by the amount of conflict and attendant human suffering going on in the world I will ask that we exclude what I would call "realistic" simulated combat games. No Castle Wolfenstein or Tour of Duty etc. Nothing that explicitly simulates taking the life of a fellow human being. But Im fine with the more abstract "combat" of something like a 1970s Atari tank battle or indeed that 1962 space war simulation.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyones participation. There were quite a few titles I was unfamiliar with. Does that mean I could have wasted hundreds more hours of my life on these things? Scary thought. Top 5...

11 + 6 - Heidi Schroeder - Our Reverend’s scathing review of a computer game (3-3)
7 + 4 - Mark Percy - Caviar egg or fettuccine served up with game. (7)
10 + 1 - Debbie Manber Kupfer - Sitter plays game with blocks (6)
8 + 1 - Saurabh Upadhyay - Plumber rams our pipes wildly removing sulphur and releasing pressure (55)
5 + 4 - Simon T. Hill - Video stars beginning to go crazy for a space-themed game (9)

Heidis neat spoonerism got in early and set the pace. Well done and over to you!

Dulce et Decorum est
Bent double like old beggars under sacks
Knock-kneed coughing like hags we cursed through sludge
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots
But limped on blood-shod. All went lame all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.

Gas! GAS! Quick boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And floundring like a man in fire or lime.—
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light
As under a green sea I saw him drowning.

In all my dreams before my helpless sight
He plunges at me guttering choking drowning.

If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face
His hanging face like a devils sick of sin
If you could hear at every jolt the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs
Obscene as cancer
Bitter as the cud
Of vile incurable sores on innocent tongues–
My friend you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.

#CFTD #2023_11_09 #Alpha_Beta_Christmas
For reasons that may become apparent in about seven weeks time or which might occur to long time participants recalling ghosts of Christmases past today please clue for any of the words / expressions on the following list. Imagine (if you will) that your clue is being presented with the first letter as usually occurs in an alphabetic jigsaw puzzle and adjust the difficulty accordingly. For todays game dont include the first letter and hopefully the extra difficulty should still be fine given that as solvers we get the headstart of knowing that its a word on the list which is even more useful than a first letter. Also for what its worth for either of the two-word phrases just use enum (14) rather than the giveaway (59) or (68).
MOP-UP BONUS: to increase the chances of getting clues for all the words and reward players who take on some of the more difficult ones others have passed over I will award bonus points for the first clue posted for any word with the bonus value increasing as the pool of words runs out. (Formula: ( number of words already done ) / 4  rounded down. So in fact theres no bonus for the first few words but six points for each of the last two to get done.) This makes it extra important for early players especially to follow the number-of-clues posted rule. For fairness we dont a lucky few online early in the game to rush through and grab all the available bonus points! In fact I will add a restriction that no individual participant can claim more than three bonuses.

   A. ANAGRAMS ( 8 )
   B. BREMEN (6)
   C. CHUTZPAH ( 8 )
   D. DISOBEYS ( 8 )

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game (e.g. while there are only 3 people in the game no more than 3 clues each) mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2023_10_29 SCAMS

Thanks Dave for yesterdays game of illness and cures. Since my winning clue was for "snake oil" lets pivot to SCAMS as the next topic. That could be products that have proven to be worthless (ignoring placebo effects for now :) ) crooked marketing schemes (that is even more crooked than normal advertising) fixed gambling games or any of the many dishonest techniques used to part fools from their money. (Although to be fair some of the scams now are polished enough that you dont have to be such a fool to be fooled.)
Now there may be some grey areas here and even scope for passionate disagreement. For instance I would personally place the entire psychic industry in the "scam" basket along with astrology and oh yes organised religion. But I do accept that some people - many people - give more credence to some of those things and even consider them to be of genuine value. So please if some cheeky participant wants to post a clue denigrating something you consider noble such as your faith lets not descend into bickering over it. If the choice of target means you dont like the clue then it is enough to not like the clue. Move on. That said some measure of tact is appropriate... theres no need for clues that use strong language to suggest that people holding particular beliefs are stupid or evil. So poke the bear if you wish but dont kick the hornets nest!

#CFTD #2023_10_27 #SUPERSTITIONS

I just read that today in the UK (well tomorrow if you are in the UK right at this moment) is National Black Cat Day. And just as I was thinking "really?" I also read that there is also a National Black Cat Appreciation Day on August 17. So its clearly a very worthy cause even if it never loomed large as one of lifes major issues in my own reckoning. Today clue for anything that people have superstitions about (positive or negative) - black cats broken mirrors etc. Given that its generally a no-no to clue for a non-idiomatic phrase like "walking under a ladder" lets also have the option of having the surface be about the superstition rather than the answer. Id whip up a quick example with "walking under a ladder" ingeniously embedded into the word play but its too early relative to my daily caffeination cycle for that sort of carry on. No doubt someone will oblige!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

#RESULTS
We had a reasonable crop of clues but not a great deal of voting. Perhaps superstition was getting the better of people... "well thats a might fine clue but Im not going near it its bound to be bad luck!" (I note the winning clue was for something that brings good luck.) Indeed only a few clues managed to score more than two and four was enough to take the gold. As usual I break ties in favour of the later-posted clue...

4 - Dave Bromage - Passion with that woman? Lucky thing! (7)
2 + 2 - Roy Leban - One way to avoid the Macbeth curse is Ramble St. S (hypothetical) (3 8 4)

3 - Steve Allen - Slags broke something sometimes broken for luck (5)
3 - Roger Cushing - Overcareful Flo damaged a good luck symbol (4-46)
3 - Catriona Malone - Deadweight bad luck wrecked Lars boats (9)
2 + 1 - Joel Hess - Threaten macho deviant with some bad luck (5 2 1 5)

Thank you for an educational outing. Ive never had much truck with superstition so many of these were new to me. I especially enjoyed reading about the "three on a match" superstition. And without further ado I hand over to Dave for the next game.

#CFTD #2023_19_17 #INSECTS

Thank you Roger for the game game. The last game I hosted was the cricket-that-is-not-cricket game which suggests something to do with an insect. And indeed my winning clue yesterday alluded to the variety of nuptial engagement favoured by some insects that involves a little more in the way of decapitation than most of us go in for. So triangulating those themes I conclude that today we are doing INSECTS. Please clue for any words or phrases to do with insects or idioms involveing them or write clues with surfaces _all_ about insects.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

#CFTD #2023_10_15 #JUST_NOT_CRICKET
At the moment India is hosting a world cup in one of the formats of cricket. Now the cryptic world is somewhat divided into those that know and (of course) love the game and those that still live in the darkness. To be fair to both camps today we will have a cricket theme but we will not have a cricket theme. Please clue for any word (or phrase) that has a cricket meaning but DO NOT clue for its cricket meaning or have anything whatsoever to do with cricket in your surface. (Well you might be forgiven for accidentally including another word which has a cricket meaning since there are so many common words that do but try not to have the surface seem to be about cricket at all!)

And the winner is ... Afghanistan! Congratulations to that cricketing minnow for its upset win over England. Not that anyone from Australia should be poking fun at the old country given where we are sitting on the ladder! It looks to me like South Africa and New Zealand are in great form in both of the sporting world cups currently under way. But anyway back to the game at hand which is not cricket to the limited extent that anything in this interconnected world can be not cricket. Thanks for everyones participation. Here are the top scores...

4 + 4 - Simon T. Hill - Hit it maybe over even (3)
7 - Roger Cushing - Remainder of puzzle (5)
6 - Melissa McSeismal - Finished again? (4)

It was another quiet game but some hearty scoring late in the innings got Simon over the line for the win. Over to you Simon!

#CFTD #2023_10_8 NUMBERS

Weve had mathematics themed games before but today Im going to be a bit more specific. Please clue for a number BUT do not simply use number or some synonym thereof as your definition. Rather draw on some specific fact that involves the number. Indeed not necessarily a mathematical fact but preferrably a bit of information from the real world. e.g. "How many referendums have passed in Australia" could be used to define "eight" or "number of tentacles on a squid" for "two" (that one is complicated due to renaming of cephalopod limbs since I went to school). You dont have to stick to integers or any other specific restricted set of numbers (rational / positive / real). "Nine and three quarters" might find some modern literary definition and yes you could even go for "two pi" or "the golden ratio" (which probably would require a more mathematical definition). Your answer could even be a phrase describing an unknown number (but a definite and known phrase) although Im struggling to think of an example of this. One thing I will be picky about - the answer must be just a number and not a physical quantity which would require units. So "How long is a piece of string" although a delightful idea is not allowed because that would be a length not a number. Likewise "height of Everest" and "speed of light" are out. Mind you some constants from physics ARE pure number - such as Avagadros number or various "coefficients" (e.g. of friction) or "indeces" (e.g. of refraction).

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

#CFTD #2023_10_6 #CNS

Today please clue for anything to do with the Central Nervous System. Im mainly thinking of physiology - parts of the brain and of neurons but you may extend to related things like mechanisms and disorders. You may also make clues where the surface is about this theme but the answer is (possibly) unrelated. (But if you take this option please make sure that the whole clue surface reads as something clearly about the CNS... its not enough just to contain a relevant word or two.)

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2023_09_07 WOMEN IN SPORT
As Very Important as the AFL I am currently watching is the highlight of my sporting world recently has been the womens soccer world cup which was hosted in these parts. I am truly by moved at the leaps and bounds we have made _towards_ gender equality in sport. (Were certainly not there yet!) Today please clue for women in sport - not necessarily trailblazers but preferably noteworthy in some respect! You may go for full names or just surnames or familiar first names nicknames etc. Keep in mind as ever when clueing names if exact spelling is going to be hard to get right try to make sure you go for a style of word play that gives the solver a fair chance. Trying to solve an anagram for a long barely familiar name from an unfamiliar culture is generally pretty futile!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2021_10_19 Misleading Homographs (Heteronyms actually)

Today please create a clue where at least one word in the clue not only has a different meaning for the cryptic reading compared to the surface reading but is pronounceed differently as well.

Example:

Attractive core of substance chopped out with axes (4)

Answer: SEXY

def: attractive
S(ubstanc)E + X Y

For the word play "axes" refers to the x- and y- axes of a cartesian graph while for the surface reading (hopefully) it seems to refer to the chopping implements. The important thing is that the two meanings come with different pronunciations.

Note that most heteronyms involve two closely related meanings of the word generally with different parts of speech. e.g. "Produce" as a noun is pronounced differently to "produce" as a verb but they are semantically very closely related. While such instances do fit the requirement of todays game I would encourage people to try to use words like "wind" and "bow" where the different meanings are really quite different.

Here is a handy list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(linguistics)#Examples

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 
Thanks for everyones participation. The misleading was successful... even though I was expecting it I swear I had to read some of the clues two or three times before the penny dropped. "Oh _that_ Nice " etc. Lots of appreciation shown too resulting in nine scores of 10 or more...

13 + 4 - Alec Macaulay - Does duty eventually expecting regular tips (4)
7 + 8 - Tony Morris - Tear up back of lab with borer (4)
8 + 6 - Heidi Schroeder - Nice drink finished before I head to supper (6)
8 + 6 - Benjamin James - Nobleman and the Queen converse (7)
6 + 6 - Neha Bhandari - That woman hiding at home is Polish (5)
6 + 6 - Cherie Maharam - Proceeds on ice slippery around mountain top (6)

7 + 4 - Tony Morris - House aptly within sound of the church bell ( 8 )
9 + 2 - Roy Leban - Some produce carbon or nitrogen (4)

Despite some impressive late efforts from Neha and Cherie Alec held on for victory so lets see what he has in store for us next!

#CFTD #2021_12_15

Thanks Sam Zipcat for a good planting game. It was nice to get such a good response to my clue evoking Miss Piggy... I suppose the key ingredient was that it resonated with her character since she always considered herself worthy of her own show (or thought that the show was built around her). So lets run with that idea...

#CFTD #2021_12_03 POPULAR CHILDRENS LITERATURE

We all (I hope) have our favourite childrens books ... today please make clues for (or surfaces all about) well known works of childrens literature and well known characters from them. (You may extend this to strong personal favourites that you feel should be better known but if the answer is obscure please make sure that the clue is gettable.) I wont make it a rule but I would prefer to see people favour books that HAVENT been eclipsed by major Disney (or other) movie adaptations.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD 10/30/2021
Well tomorrow being Halloween its almost obligatory to do something spooky. But lets do something a little less traditional and celebrate one of the favorite authors of my youth Edgar Allen Poe who lived for a time in my hometown of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Most people are familar with his creepy poems (such as The Raven Annabel Lee and Lenore) and short stories (like The Fall of the House of Usher The Tell-Tale Heart The Pit and the Pendulum and The Cask of Amontillao) at least in America where theyre frequently taught in the schools. But one of my favorites is the haunted Ulalume in which Poe returned to one of his most frequent themes the death of a beloved one. The poem makes ample use of the sounds and colors of the English language and so is a perfect choice for your challenge: set any word of five or more letters from the poem. One point for likes two for love care or surprise three for wow. And an extra point for any clue I deem sufficiently eerie or Halloween-like. So a lot of points to be made. Contest will close tomorrow around 4PM Pacific Time. Have fun!
ULALUME
The skies they were ashen and sober;
The leaves they were crisped and sere—
The leaves they were withering and sere;
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year:
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber
In the misty mid region of Weir—
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
Here once through an alley Titanic
Of cypress I roamed with my Soul—
Of cypress with Psyche my Soul.
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll—
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole—
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole.
Our talk had been serious and sober
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—
Our memories were treacherous and sere—
For we knew not the month was October
And we marked not the night of the year
(Ah night of all nights in the year!)—
We noted not the dim lake of Auber
(Though once we had journeyed down here)—
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
And now as the night was senescent
And star-dials pointed to morn—
As the star-dials hinted of morn—
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn—
Astartes bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn.
And I said: "She is warmer than Dian;
She rolls through an ether of sighs—
She revels in a region of sighs:
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks where the worm never dies
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies—
To the Lethean peace of the skies—
Come up in despite of the Lion
To shine on us with her bright eyes—
Come up through the lair of the Lion
With love in her luminous eyes."
But Psyche uplifting her finger
Said: "Sadly this star I mistrust—
Her pallor I strangely mistrust:
Ah hasten! —ah let us not linger!
Ah fly! —let us fly! -for we must."
In terror she spoke letting sink her
Wings until they trailed in the dust—
In agony sobbed letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust—
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.
I replied: "This is nothing but dreaming:
Let us on by this tremulous light!
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its Sybilic splendour is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty tonight!—
See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming
And be sure it will lead us aright—
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her
And tempted her out of her gloom—
And conquered her scruples and gloom;
And we passed to the end of the vista
But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
By the door of a legended tomb;
And I said: "What is written sweet sister
On the door of this legended tomb?"
She replied: "Ulalume -Ulalume—
Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere—
As the leaves that were withering and sere;
And I cried: "It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed—I journeyed down here!—
That I brought a dread burden down here—
On this night of all nights in the year
Ah what demon hath tempted me here?
Well I know now this dim lake of Auber—
This misty mid region of Weir—
Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber
This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."

 yes but if you read an Islamic feminists thoughts on the matter you will get a different perspective ... indeed some Muslim women wear their traditional garb (whichever it may be) against their husbands preference. In the west we have a tradition (lessened happily by some progress in the area I believe) of insisting that women are constantly judged by their appearance no matter the social or professional context. The modesty traditions of Islam and some branches of Christianity are in part about liberating women from that constant judgement. It is notable that several Muslim nations had female heads of state or government before Australia did.

#CFTD #2021_10_09

Thanks to Cherie for a beaut game yesterday and well done to Neha for the actual winning the ball before passing it to me and Sam for handballing back to me after Id tried to move it on quickly to him. (In the parlance of local footy commentary when the ball is directed toward a group of unopposed team mates "they could raffle it".)  Its seems the roulette ball has dropped onto my number once gravity claimed its inevitable triumph. Today lets clue for ways of selecting a random winner - drawing lots roll of the dice toss of a coin etc. Interesting regional customs if you have some to share...

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyones participation. Here are the 10+ scores which came from eight different setters. Great to see! And despite a late dash from Simons clever surface the nice punny clue from Sam at the start of the game held on for victory...

17 + 14 - Sam Zipcat - Determining how Da Vinci became so skilled? (74)
13 + 14 - Simon T. Hill - Sailor’s death at sea is questioned by arbitrator (525)

10 + 8 - Juhi Saklani - He cited time-honoured gambling procedure (4 2 3 4)
9 + 7 - Joel Hess - My enemy - one enemy - I defeated for a way to choose a winner (4 5 4 3)
12 + 4 -Nat Rengasamy - Many attempt to get first entry in the game of chance (7)
10 + 6 - Heidi Schroeder - Re-styling plain coif is one way to turn heads! (414)

8 + 2 - Bec Crannaford - Zip into rodeo running wild with a right to get something for just turning up (45)
8 + 2 - Roy Leban - Strange icon - it shows a head half the time (4)

Well done to everyone and I shall pass the baton (sorry about the endlessly mixed sporting metaphors) to Sam who may at his discretion wish to run with it or pass it on again. (Sometimes it feels like we could have a side game laying bets on who will host the next CFTD...)

#CFTD #2021_09_27

Happy timing allowed a fairly straightforward clue of mine to take the last game but just near the end I thought of one I was happier with for TRUFFULA the vital tree of Dr Suesss masterpiece The Lorax. After an enthusiastic discussion on the topic of that author it seemed to me a pretty fair idea for our next theme. So please clue for anything related to the LIFE AND WORK OF THEODOR SEUSS GEISEL (DR. SEUSS). Biographical details famous stories his invented creatures and words. As ever if you are cluing for an obscure title name or made-up word please try to use a form of word play that gives the solver a fighting chance of arriving at the correct answer even if they dont know it or are unsure of the spelling. This will be especially important for the good doctors sillier inventions!

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting
    Or being lied about don’t deal in lies
Or being hated don’t give way to hating
    And yet don’t look too good nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss
And lose and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
    If all men count with you but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man my son!

WILD GEESE 
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair yours and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes
over the prairies and the deep trees
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese high in the clean blue air
are heading home again.
Whoever you are no matter how lonely
the world offers itself to your imagination
calls to you like the wild geese harsh and exciting -
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.

#CFTD #2021_08_17

Today lets celebrate COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CULTURES ... especially anything to do with overcoming language barriers e.g. PHRASE BOOOK / GOOGLE TRANSLATE / ESPERANTO / LINGUA FRANCA / BABEL FISH / GESTICULATION / BODY LANGUAGE. Clue for any such thing or make clues whose surface is all about the theme (i.e. not just which happen to contain a key word).

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyones participation. And it was also good to see plenty of voting - I usually list entries scoring 10 points and above in the results - I settled for 12+ this time but its still quite a big roll call...

15 + 12 - Juhi Saklani - Snuggle again passionately! Use your hands to communicate! ( 4 ￼8 )

15 + 4 - Saurabh Upadhyay - Try and stare or get a translator (6)
13 + 6 - Raj Jayaram - Brave method of communication like mass-song remix (57)

13 + 4 - Simon T. Hill - Baffled as naked husbands join a digital meeting (9)

6 + 10 - Alec Macaulay - Light up and cycle a long way (5)
12 + 4 - Oisin Clarke-Willis - Rotates translation stone (7)
12 + 4 - Raj Jayaram - Hopes are built around primarily marine form of communication (9)
14 + 2 - Heidi Schroeder - A visual representation of a musical instruments sound (6)

9 + 6 - Binay Patra - Highly prose style of ancient writing system (11)
11 + 4 - Sam Zipcat - Unscrambles mixed signal (6)

10 + 4 - Heidi Schroeder - Bachelor appearing in lustiest new film feature (9)
10 + 4 - Raj Jayaram - Kind of code integral to algorithm or sequence (5)

8 + 4 - Melissa McSeismal - Sixth sense exposed desperate tirade mid-story in language meant to be unifying {9}
6 + 6 - Monty Green - Perhaps Ruth starts listening to chum possibly with in-ear translator? (54)

Great to see so many people contributing bringing their many different flavours of clue to the game for our enjoyment. At least one new name to me in there - welcome Oisin and nice work today. Todays winner with sound amrous advice is Juhi... who could argue with the value of a nice passionate snuggle complete with manual communication? Congratulations and over to you Juhi!

From this weeks new puzzle at Bens Cryptics "A Brownlow Champion":
https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/puzzle654a.html
Its an alphabetic jigsaw style crossword this week with an extra twist: each clue ignores the first letter of the answer in the word play. (e.g. "A time for pet (3)" might clue for "CAT")

From this weeks new puzzle at Bens Cryptics "A Brownlow Champion":
https://ibendr.github.io/xwd/bendr/puzzle654a.html
Its an alphabetic jigsaw style crossword but it can still be done online (awkwardly) and theres a link to a "normal" version as well. (Refer to both together for the easiest version!) BUT this week theres another catch: in both versions each clue ignores the first letter of the answer in the word play. (e.g. "A time for pet (3)" might clue for "CAT") That adds little difficulty in the jigsaw version where the clues are indexed by first letter so you always know what it is anyway. But for the non-jigsaw version which uses the same clues it might make things quite tricky and you may have to use a bit of reasoning by elimination to get through.

#CFTD #2021_07_27 Oh Lordy the RINGs!
The Olympics are providing a feast of inconsequential distraction and although they have already provided at least one CFTD theme I think we can afford to wring one more out of them! Today...
(i) clue for the word RING or any synonym of it in any sense (including derived forms e.g. RANG CIRCLES)
(ii) clue for any word or phrase containing RING e.g. "meringues" or "infringes"
(iii) use at least TWO occurrences of the letter sequence RING in your clue
Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3
Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#example of (iii)
Leaders of poor in general have fringes of gay muppet diva? (5)
P I G + G(a)Y

#RESULTS 

Thanks for everyones participation. Once again a nice spread of scores with five different setters in the top five bringing us a diversity of clue styles to enjoy.

#CFTD #2021_07_25 TRIPLE TROUBLE
Yes "triple" letters are the essence of todays game. Please clue for any word that satisfies this condition: the first letter is the same as the last letter AND the same as the middle letter (or both middle letters for an even-length word). This is one of the tautest conditions Ive set offering one of the rarer subsets of the English lexicon to be dredged up which I wont enumerate here BUT this text contains numerous "suggestions"!

#CFTD #2021_07_22 #FIBONACCI
Congratulations to yesterdays winner Juhi and thank you for entrusting me with the responsibility of launching todays game. And well done to Alec for a stimulating game as well as a nice tribute to a classic tortured artist. Todays theme may require a little bit more research on your part since I wont be giving you the word list on a plate this time (or even in a saucerful of secrets). Todays theme is FIBONACCI - the name the mathematician the number sequence and all things related to the above particularly mathematically. Those already in the know will realise RABBIT population growth may be involved as well as a GOLDEN RATIO but there is so much more when you go looking...

#RESULTS 

This topic proved quite challenging. I must admit although the mathematical topic itself is rich in connections and associations related vocabulary (accessible to a broader audience) didnt seem all that plentiful as I found when I tried to come up with a few more words to offer when answering Sams comment.

Of course what I could have done to encourage participation is use a chain-tagging scheme: Each player "in the game" posts a clue every hour and from their second clue onwards they also tag a new player into the game each time. Then starting with just one player we would have had hourly clue tallies of 11235813... :)

Here are the podium clues...

12 + 12 - SSv Avtaar - Queen’s unhappy with Church order ( 8 )
6 + 6 - Melissa McSeismal - Manuscript of famous pianist in recital about sailor {5 5}
7 + 4 - Nat Rengasamy - Cocaine and opium for example are what the series is based upon (7 7)

Congratulations to SSv running away with the votes for a clue with a nice and neat perfectly plausible surface. Over to you!

#CFTD #2021_07_19

We are counting down to the 2020 Olympics (having just completed Euro 2020... I think you could be forgiven for being a bit confused and putting the wrong date on forms this year) possibly destined to be the first olympics in living memory which WONT be declared "the best olympic games ever". (I say "possibly" because some hyperbolic traditions are hard to relinquish. But hopefully theyll get a bit creative and select some other appropriate superlative to apply this time around.) Today please clue for CURRENT OLYMPIC EVENTS (i.e. events that are included in this Olympiad). Beware becase they do the ring the changes! There are some new ones in but others have gone by the wayside.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#RESULTS - It looks like things have gone very quiet for the last several hours ... perhaps a new working week intervened! The reactions were correspondingly a bit thin for most of the later clues but we had some lovely entries. I particularly liked Heidis clue highlighting the quest in equestrian which came close to winning thanks to plenty of 3-point rewards. But todays winner is Sam Zipcat with his tasty olympic kebab stall...

12 + 4 - Sam Zipcat - Kebab stall catered for Olympic sport (10)
8 + 7 - Heidi Schroeder - Olympic event nearly rained out. Holding pursuit inside (10)
8 + 6 - Roy Leban - Outside of Korea martial art became ultimately an olympic sport (6)
9 + 2 - ￼Simon T. Hill - Girls went crazy for sport (9)
9 + 2 - Monty Green - Wanked too vigorously for martial art! (9)
￼
...thanks everyone and over to you Sam!

#CFTD #2021_06_28 - LOCAL ICONS

Lets see some provincial pride and neighbourly name-dropping! Today please clue for famous people or things that have their origins in - OR are widely associated with - somewhere near you. Im being deliberately vague rather than specifying "your country" or "your town" ... cast the net as wide as you need to in order to find an interesting subject! As usual the more obscure your answer (especially if it is a name with the potential spelling anomalies that come with names) the more you should try to use a form of word play that gives the solver a fighting chance of arriving at the correct spelling even if they dont know it.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

#CFTD #2021_06_26 - NAMES with ALLITERATION

Thanks to Victor for an interesting game with the 6-word limit really making us tighten up our surfaces. (I discovered last summer that falling asleep at the beach can also result in tightening up of ones surfaces - I swear the leg I left in full sun ended up with crackling on it. But I digress...) Todays theme will possibly see us straying in the other direction but I would still encourage people to keep their clues nice and compact if they can.

Today clue for ALLITERATIVE NAMES (of real life people or things or ones taken from well known fiction). So any names where both parts start with the same sound even if its not the same letter. (e.g. Clark Kent). (Conversely same letter is no good if the sound is nt the same - e.g. dont clue for "Saint Sharon" even though both parts start with s.) You can go for names with more than two parts as long as they ALL start with the same sound e.g. Ku Klux Klan.

Scoring: like/laugh = 1  cry/care = 2  love/wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!

BEES - clue for words or phrases to do wth bees

One of the under-reported big issues of our time is the crisis in apiculture globally. (Its not just about honey!) One of those things that flies under the radar as the mundane business of food production seems to be of little interest to the western media. Clearly people are more worried about royal babies and celebrity boxing matches than about feeding humanity. So lets all read up about bees and share some new vocabulary and knowledge with one another. (For instance I just learnt that "apiary" does NOT mean bee-keeping.)

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS

Thanks for everyones participation. Sorry for the slight delay in results. There was a concerned raised with me about whether the winning clue was effectively a rerun which has been a topic of discussion recently. I have looked at some previous clues for the same word on CCS that have used a similar word play but to my mind the definitions and surfaces were quite different. Indeed none I saw had used "ask" for "poll" which I think gives Jeremys clue much of its character hinting at echoes of JFK "ask what you can do for your country". So I have no problem with awarding the game the way the votes fell and handing the baton to Jeremy.

PM to Jeremy:
Hi Jeremy. Firstly well done on winning the Clue-For-The-Day contest at CCS yesterday. Im sorry if the experience was marred either by Chris bickering about the correctness of the clue (and I didnt think his objection made sense really) or by the suggestion that was put to me (and which I reported but dismissed in announcing the results) that the clue was recycled.

Anyway the convention is that the winner of the days game gets to host the next game so although theres been a bit of a delay youre still welcome to take that on.

But if you dont want to please let us know and we can keep the ball rolling with someone else posting a game. (If we havent heard from you soon well go ahead and do that anyway.)

BOTHER! Today please clue for words or phrases about things being bothersome ranging from people or things which peeve (miscreant pest brat parasite etc.) to things going wrong (problem issue glitch hiccup fly in the ointment bug spanner in the works SNAFU etc.) Please stick to words which have (at least potentially) this general meaning as opposed to specific things which you categorise thus. (For instance dont clue for "protestor" ... even though you may consider a protestor to be bothersome the word has not taken on that general meaning. Likewise "power outage" "child" "red tape" may all at times be frustrating things but are too specific for todays game.)

#CFTD #2021_05_18

Todays theme is CHOCOLATE. Clue for something to do with chocolate or use a reference to such in your surface. PLEASE make sure that you have read / solved / judged some other clues before jumping in (unless youre first in of course). If youve come late to the game and there are already hundreds of clues at least go through and read some of them - perhaps go through the more recent ones (to help later entries) and scan the earlier ones for those scoring well and add likes to your favourites.

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!


#RESULTS

Thanks for everyones participation. I must apologise for being a something of an absentee host as I am doing some granddad-childcare currently. Some of the clues I did have time to read were quite pleasing in various ways. Like chocolate! Here are the top three with a strong 1-3 finish for Heidi to whom I now happily pass the baton.

8 + 5 - Heidi Schroeder - Chocolatier’s keen about gold wrapping fudge and blueberry fillings (7)

CACTUS
Thorns are my language.
I announce my existence
with a bleeding touch.
Once these thorns were flowers.
I loathe lovers who betray.
Poets have abandoned the deserts
to go back to the gardens.
Only camels remain here and merchants
who trample my blooms to dust.
One thorn for each rare drop of water.
I don’t tempt butterflies
no bird sings my praise.
I don’t yield to droughts.
I create another beauty
beyond the moonlight
this side of dreams
a sharp piercing
parallel language.

#CFTD #2021_05_09 #PUZZLES
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle
As seems to be popular these days I will pivot via the previous winning clue which was for SUDOKU to a new theme which will be PUZZLES. Please clue for any types of puzzle... which could vary from the general ("RIDDLE") to the specific ("SEVEN BRIDGES OF KONIGSBERG"). For famous puzzles which end in the word "puzzle" I think it would be best to omit that word and clue for the rest of the name e.g. "EIGHT QUEENS". For obscure and/or proprietary names (e.g. names specific to a publication like "QUIPTIC") please make sure that your word play gives a fair chance of solving even for those unfamiliar. NOTE that Ive tweaked the scoring to make a laugh worth 1 point. Sometimes a clue gives me a chuckle without being a good clue for other reasons - I like the idea of a reaction that gives a point for the humour to such a clue. If its funny AND good and so you think it warrants two points give it a care (or wow for three).

Scoring: laugh/like = 1  love/cry/care = 2  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game mark reruns #nfc etc. etc. and have fun!
