Today's theme is CHOCOLATE. Clue for something to do with chocolate, or use a reference to such in your surface. PLEASE make sure that you have read / solved / judged some other clues before jumping in (unless you're first in of course). If you've come late to the game and there are already hundreds of clues, at least go through and read some of them - perhaps go through the more recent ones (to help later entries) and scan the earlier ones for those scoring well and add likes to your favourites.

Scoring: like = 1  laugh/love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

CACTUS
Thorns are my language.
I announce my existence
with a bleeding touch.
Once these thorns were flowers.
I loathe lovers who betray.
Poets have abandoned the deserts
to go back to the gardens.
Only camels remain here, and merchants,
who trample my blooms to dust.
One thorn for each rare drop of water.
I don’t tempt butterflies,
no bird sings my praise.
I don’t yield to droughts.
I create another beauty
beyond the moonlight,
this side of dreams,
a sharp, piercing,
parallel language.

#CFTD #2021_05_09 #PUZZLES
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle
As seems to be popular these days, I will pivot via the previous winning clue, which was for SUDOKU, to a new theme, which will be PUZZLES. Please clue for any types of puzzle... which could vary from the general ("RIDDLE") to the specific ("SEVEN BRIDGES OF KONIGSBERG"). For famous puzzles which end in the word "puzzle", I think it would be best to omit that word and clue for the rest of the name, e.g. "EIGHT QUEENS". For obscure and/or proprietary names (e.g. names specific to a publication, like "QUIPTIC") please make sure that your word play gives a fair chance of solving even for those unfamiliar. NOTE that I've tweaked the scoring to make a laugh worth 1 point. Sometimes a clue gives me a chuckle, without being a good clue for other reasons - I like the idea of a reaction that gives a point for the humour to such a clue. If it's funny AND good and so you think it warrants two points, give it a 'care' (or 'wow' for three).

Scoring: laugh/like = 1  love/cry/care = 2,  wow = 3

Usual rules - read/solve/like the other clues, no more clues-per-setter than setters in the game, mark reruns #nfc, etc. etc. and have fun!
