The Hollywood Sign, is an American landmark and cultural icon overlooking Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Originally the Hollywoodland Sign, it is situated on Mount Lee, in the Beachwood Canyon area of the Santa Monica Mountains. Spelling out the word “HOLLYWOOD” in 50-foot-tall (15.2 m) white uppercase letters and 450 feet (137.2 m) long,[1] it was originally erected in 1923 as a temporary advertisement for a local real estate development, but due to increasing recognition the sign was left up,[2] and replaced in 1978 with a more durable all-steel structure. 

...

The restoration and removal of the "land" portion of the sign was conducted in September 1949

...

The sign's unprotected wood-and-sheet-metal structure deteriorated over the years. After a storm on 10 February 1978, the first O was splintered and broken, resembling a lowercase u, and the third O had fallen down completely, leaving the severely dilapidated sign reading "HuLLYWO D."[19][15]

In 1978, in large part because of the public campaign to restore the landmark by Hugh Hefner, founder of Playboy magazine, the Chamber set out to replace the severely deteriorated sign with a more permanent structure. Nine donors gave US$27,778 each (totaling US$250,000, equivalent to $1,040,000 in 2021) to sponsor replacement letters, made of steel supported by steel columns on a concrete foundation (see Donors section below).
