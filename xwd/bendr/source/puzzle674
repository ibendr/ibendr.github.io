#CFTD 2021_11_25
Towards the end of each year I make a puzzle for which I crowd-source the clues from CFTD. This year's I have set a grid with a Covid vaccine theme. For today's contest, please clue for any of these words...
You may use cross references to other answers, and indeed this is encouraged for the names of vaccines and their developers / manufacturers. Later in the game there will be bonus points if you clue for a word that hasn't been done yet (I'd like to get clues for all of them) to the tune of 1 point for every two hours the game has been up. (But please repect the number-of-clues-per-setter restriction below.)
Please let me know if you do not wish to have your clue used in the final puzzle, or if you do not wish your name to be used (or if you have a prefered version of your name different to your FB name.)
Scoring- like=1, wow=3, other reactions=2
No more clues per settter than setters in the game. Read, solve, annotate and reward other people's clues. And have fun!
