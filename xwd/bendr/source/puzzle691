The Burundian Genocide against the Hutu begins; more than 500,000 Hutus die. (29 - gov't dissolved, Hutu uprising, Ntare executed)

The Ikiza (variously translated from Kirundi as the Catastrophe, the Great Calamity, the Scourge) or the Ubwicanyi (Killings) was a series of mass killings—often characterised as a genocide—which were committed in Burundi in 1972 by the Tutsi-dominated army and government, primarily against educated and elite Hutus who lived in the country.
