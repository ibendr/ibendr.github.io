The 1973 Chilean coup d'état[7][8] was a military overthrow of the Popular Unity government in Chile, led by President Salvador Allende. Allende, the first Socialist to be elected president in a Latin American liberal democracy,[8] faced significant social unrest, political tension with the opposition-controlled Congress, and economic warfare ordered by US President Richard Nixon.[9] On September 11, 1973, a group of military officers, led by General Augusto Pinochet, seized power in a coup, ending civilian rule.
